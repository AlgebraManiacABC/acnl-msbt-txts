"flg09"	Any place can be a farm when	you're packin' a full-duty 4x4	and muscles like Tad's. His	motto? If it makes you sore,	then do some more!
"flg11"	He likes his coffee like he likes	his camping—scorching hot.	That's why he barely ever leaves	his van, although the vending	machine is another big reason.
"flg15"	Wouldn't it be nice to know that	a licensed doctor is nearby at	the campground? We wouldn't	know because Raddle is most	definitely NOT a real doctor.

"gor11"	No matter where her travels	take her, Rilla always packs her	favorite Hello Kitty shirt. She's	had it since she was a little girl.	Can you tell?
"ham08"	His camper's tires are specially	coated so he never loses	control, even on rainy days or	icy roads. Mostly because it also	prevents him from ever driving.

"lon04"	Leopold's camper is all set up	as a mobile classroom, but the	only subject he wants to teach	is PE. Hope you like doing	burpees!

"oct03"	A Splatoon superfan, Inkwell's	decided to leave his past behind	and create a new identity as a	squid. It'd be going better if his	eight legs weren't so obvious.

"ost05"	Julia loves to entertain, and	what setting could possibly be	more intimate than the cramped	interior of a camping van?

"pgn09"	Wade loves camping, cooking,	and danger. So grilling food on	an undampened cedar plank is	basically his idea of heaven.
"pig09"	Boris is always happy to host	a double feature, but you do	NOT want to spill any popcorn	kernels in his recliner. Ask me	how I know...
"pig10"	Maggie treats her flowers as	family and her family as	flowers. In case that's confusing,	let's just say she treats them all	quite well.

"rbt14"	Now, now...Hopkins doesn't	just go camping to sit in his	van and play video games. He	also drinks orange juice in	there.
"rbt20"	If Toby put as much time into	maintaining his camper as he	does into his Kerokerokeroppi	collection, he wouldn't have to	take it to the shop all the time. 
"rhn02"	With his punk-rock looks and	gruff demeanor, Spike can be	a little scary. But if you like to	skate, he'll be your BFF in	a heartbeat.
"rhn04"	Hornsby's low-key comedy tour	starts at the campground! So	far, it's just knock-knock jokes.	We should keep him and Shrunk	from ever meeting up...
"shp03"	Campground feeling a bit chilly?	Stop by Stella's camper for a 	handwoven scarf. They're	acrylic, mind you, but they're	as soft as real wool.
"shp04"	Cashmere can't live without	her famous paella, but with this	fancy new van, she doesn't have	to! She'll offer you some too...	IF you know what it is.
"shp14"	Inspired by Kiki and Lala, Étoile	wants to make the world a	better place. Of course, first	she has to actually SEE the	world. Hence the camper.

"squ20"	Viché and her sister love	traveling to different 	conventions to show off their	latest cosplay—now featuring	Marie of the Squid Sisters.

"gor04"	Un gimnasio sobre ruedas puede	resultar extraño, pero a Lou no	le pareció mala idea. Todo es	cuestión de ventilar bien...	o no sudar demasiado.

"squ20"	Su mayor afición es hacer	cosplay con su hermana Arduna,	vistiéndose de las Calamarciñas.	Su hermana es Mar, ella es Tina	¡y así nunca se pelean!
"tig02"	Va en busca de compañeros	para practicar deportes, pero	siempre les exige demasiado.	A lo mejor por eso siempre	acaba jugando solo.

"wol08"	El buen gusto se refleja en esos	pequeños detalles que pasan	desapercibidos a la mayoría.	¿Ves con qué cuidado está todo	colocado? ¡Pues no se toca!

"elp05"	Paolo n'est pas un maniaque de	la douche : il n'en prend qu'une	par jour, juste après son bain. À	la fois le campeur et l'éléphant	le plus propre qu'on ait connu.
"elp07"	Le camping-car d'Ella abrite des	tas de bonbons et une cafetière	de compétition. Bref, de quoi	donner quelques sueurs froides	au Perchoir, avis à Robusto!
"elp11"	Chaï aspire à saisir l'essence du	monde de Cinnamoroll depuis	son camping-car, et à découvrir	la technique ultime pour voler	en battant des oreilles.

"flg11"	Bajoue aime que son café soit à	son image : chaud bouillant.	Vedette dans l'âme, il se	cherche des fans, mais ne	trouve même pas de talent.
"flg15"	Il est rassurant de penser qu'un	docteur loge à la caravanerie...	Mais on se contentera de le	penser, car Fabien est tout sauf	un médecin digne de ce nom!

"ham08"	Le revêtement spécial des pneus	de sa caravane lui permet	d'ignorer l'aquaplanage et le	verglas. Notamment parce qu'il	l'empêche de rouler...

"hrs07"	Cléa n'emporte pas du travail à	la maison : elle en emporte à la	caravanerie. Ses dossiers dans	une patte et son téléphone dans	l'autre, elle n'arrête jamais!

"kgr02"	Son bébé dans la poche du matin	au soir, quand Kanga se repose-	t-elle? Dès qu'elle entre dans	son camping-car plein de	joujoux pour le petit, pardi!
"lon02"	À l'intérieur, Léo paresse	parfois un peu, mais sitôt le	museau dehors, il s'élance vers	les cimes pour y déguster de 	gargantuesques pique-niques!
"lon04"	Le camping-car de Leandro	ressemble à une école... où on	n'enseignerait que le sport!	Mieux vaut s'échauffer avant	de lui rendre visite!
"mus08"	Sucrette a toujours un petit	quelque chose pour chacun. Elle	préférerait avoir tout pour tout	le monde, mais où trouver la	place dans son camping-car?
"oct03"	Il est complètement obsédé par	un certain jeu appelé Splatoon,	et son but dans la vie est de	devenir un calamar. Ne le traitez	surtout pas de poulpe...
"ost02"	Au camping, rien ne vaut un bon	café... avec quelques biscuits.	Et peut-être une part de gâteau.	Dans tous les cas, Ottie est là et	s'occupe de tous les estomacs!
"ost03"	Laflèche profite des vacances	pour travailler sa voix. Le hic,	c'est qu'il y a un malentendu :	le but est de chanter le plus	juste possible, pas le plus fort...
"ost05"	À la table de Julie, tout le	monde se régale! Dans son	camping-car comme dans sa	cuisine, la bonne humeur est	toujours au menu!
"pbr03"	Phébus est un cordon-bleu, mais	selon ses goûts. Tu n'aimes pas	la mayo? Maintenant si, coco!	Tu n'aimes pas qu'on t'appelle	« coco »? Maintenant si, coco!
"pgn09"	Miglou n'aime rien tant que le	camping, la cuisine et le danger.	Sa définition du bonheur? Faire	un barbecue sous un arbre	en plein orage.
"pig09"	Boris est toujours partant pour	inviter ses amis à regarder un	bon film, mais évite de renverser	tes popcorns sur son canapé...	C'est un conseil gratuit.
"pig10"	Dans l'esprit de Marjorie, les	fleurs sont ses amies, et ses	amis sont des fleurs. Tu as du	mal à suivre? Disons qu'elle est	gentille avec tout le monde.
"pig18"	Espérons que Ganon n'est pas là	pour s'approprier les pouvoirs	de la Triforce, mais pour se la	couler douce... Les méchants	aussi ont droit à des vacances!
"rbt11"	Claude adore inviter ses amis à	faire une partie de jeu de	société. Il les laisse même	tricher, pour peu qu'ils ne	dévorent pas tous les gâteaux.
"rbt14"	Grignote ne fait pas du camping	juste pour jouer aux jeux vidéo	dans son camping-car toute la	journée. Non, il boit aussi du	jus d'orange en même temps.
"rbt20"	Si Toby soignait autant son	camping-car que sa collection	Kerokerokeroppi, il n'aurait pas	autant d'ennuis mécaniques...	Mais son garagiste lui dit merci!

"rhn04"	Cornio est venu à la caravanerie	pour peaufiner son stand-up.	Enfin, son recueil de blagues	vaseuses. Note pour plus tard :	ne pas lui présenter Ciboulot!
"shp03"	Le fond de l'air est frais? Passe	au camping-car de Bigoudi et tu	repartiras une chaude écharpe	faite maison autour du cou!	Merci qui?
"shp04"	Cashmir est une fana de la	paella, d'où ce camping-car	qui lui permet de vivre sa	passion! D'ailleurs, elle t'en	offrira peut-être... Peut-être.
"shp14"	Grande fan de Kiki and Lala,	Étoile ne rêve que de rendre le	monde meilleur. Mais pour ça,	elle doit d'abord le découvrir,	d'où le camping-car!

"squ14"	Jamais aussi heureuse que	devant ses fourneaux, Mounia	rêve de devenir une cuisinière	réputée... D'ici là, elle s'entraîne	à la dure avec un réchaud.
"squ19"	Kala et sa sœur Mara sont	de grandes fans des sœurs	Ventouse. Kala prend le cosplay	tellement au sérieux qu'elle ne	répond qu'au nom d'Ayo!
"squ20"	Mara et sa sœur Kala adorent	se rendre à de nombreuses	conventions pour montrer leurs	costumes. En ce moment, c'est	celui d'Oly, des sœurs Ventouse.
"tig02"	Jeff ne cherche pas d'amis :	Jeff cherche des victimes à	laminer sur le terrain, le court, la	piste, n'importe où, à n'importe	quel sport. Des volontaires?
"wol04"	Loupiot voulait skier, mais il a	confondu sa valise « ski » avec	sa valise « bouquins au coin du	feu ». Maintenant que c'est fait,	autant mettre ses chaussons.
"wol08"	Viviane a passé des heures à	ranger son camping-car. Si tu	touches au moindre objet...	Elle le remettra à sa place en te	priant de ne pas recommencer.
"wol11"	Le Héros légendaire te fait	l'honneur de sa présence! En	personne! Et il parle même aux	gens! Mais il ne te donnera pas	d'astuce pour terminer son jeu...
