"041"	{emote: Happiness}People say I'm too competitive!{pause 20}	Well, what's so bad about that,	{Player nickname (green)}?	Like, {0005-0004-0002-cd00} and I were both	going into a store the other day	at the same time.	{emote: Resigned}One of us HAD to go in first, right?{pause 20}	So what else could I do?

"050"	{emote: Thought}Hmm.{pause 5}.{pause 5}.{pause 5} A glass skipper?{Wait for input} That	doesn't sound familiar. {pause 10}{emote: Agreement}But I bet	you're right, {Player nickname (green)}.{pause 5}.{pause 5}.{pause 5} 	{emote: Curious}So was the princess actually a	sailor?{pause 20} And she left her skipper	behind?{pause 20} Who steered the boat?	{emote: Distress}Well, if she crashed that boat on an	island, it sorta serves her right!{pause 20}	You never abandon your captain!

"053"	{emote: Thought}Hmm.{pause 5}.{pause 5}.{pause 5} A poison saddle?{Wait for input} That	doesn't sound familiar. {pause 10}{emote: Agreement}Well, I bet	you're right, {Player nickname (green)}.{pause 5}.{pause 5}.{pause 5} 	{emote: Curious}So the princess was actually a	cowboy or something? {pause 10}Or a	rodeo queen?	{emote: Worry}Then how'd she ever wake up	again? Did her prince lasso her?{Wait for input}	{emote: Disagreement}Wow, what a weird fairy tale!
