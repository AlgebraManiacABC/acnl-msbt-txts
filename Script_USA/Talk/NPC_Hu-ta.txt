"004"	{pause 20}Welcome to the	{000e-0004-0000}{Town name (pink)} Museum.
"005"	Take your time...{pause 10} Do look around...
"006"	{emote: Happiness}Our museum is second to none, may	I humbly say. {pause 10}Brimming with fish!{pause 5}	Chock full of fossils!	And blessed with every work of art!{pause 10}	{emote: Joy}Yes, the {Town name (pink)} museum is	extraordinary. {pause 5}Hootie hoo!

"008"	{emote: Happiness}Our insect exhibit is unparalleled!	Visitors do, {pause 5}shall I say, {pause 5}swarm	here from all over to see it.	Please enjoy the collection, and	then spread, {pause 5}if I dare, {pause 5}the buzz.
"009"	{emote: Happiness}Our aquarium is truly outstanding!	Indeed, {pause 5}we reel in visitors from	far and wide.	So please be sure to enjoy our	fascinating fish. I think you'll	get along, {pause 5}if I may, {pause 5}swimmingly.
"010"	{emote: Happiness}Our fossil collection is especially	superb, you know. {pause 10}The exhibit here	is anything but dry and dusty!	You couldn't see more dinosaurs,{pause 5}	in fact, {pause 5}without a time machine.	So please enjoy them all.

"012"	{emote: Happiness}Our museum is nearly full. {pause 5}It brims	with fish, {pause 5}and I wouldn't say it's	infested with insects, {pause 5}but it's close.	Yet if it's portraits or fossils you	seek, {pause 5}those exhibits are nearing	completion too. Enjoy them all.
"013"	{emote: Happiness}Our museum is filling up, I'll have	you know. {pause 5}Yes, we've been	feathering this nest quite nicely.	So if you're in the mood for this or	that, you'll be sure to find it.{pause 5}	Visitors always leave quite satisfied.

"083"	Why, Mayor! {pause 10}I was just trying my	best to solve a dilemma. But I must	admit, I'm fairly stuck.	Oh! {emote: Inspired}May I ask your thoughts on	the matter?
"084"	{emote: Reset}Though our collection has grown,	our museum just isn't drawing the	attendance I hoped for.

He is a master coffee brewer.{pause 8}	{emote: Sadness}But this fellow has no place where	he can put his skills to use!	{emote: Thought}So why not open a café here in	{Town name (pink)}?

"094"	{emote: Surprise}Of course, the answer is standing	right before me. {Wait for input}{emote: Happiness}You, Mayor!{pause 5}	You have the power, hoo.	A {Blue}café{Color Reset} would benefit {Town name (pink)}!{pause 10}	In fact, what sort of town doesn't	have a proper coffeemonger?	{emote: Happiness}Yes, I'm firmly convinced. {pause 10}I'll	be sure to share this plan with	your secretary, {Orange}Isabelle{Color Reset}.	The fate of the café, {pause 5}indeed, {pause 5}of my	good friend too, {pause 5}is in your hands,	Mayor. {pause 10}My thanks in advance.{000d-0000-0002-cd06}
