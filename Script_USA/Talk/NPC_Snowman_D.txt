"041"	Have you already met my family?{Wait for input}It may seem as though we lack a{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 20}	cohesive theme. But that's not the	case when we're in our other form.
"042"	I may not look it now, but I was	quite the slim gentleman in my	younger years.	But once I became a family man, I	began gaining weight. And now I	have quite an impressive waistline.
"043"	Standing all day is not as much	of a chore as you might imagine.{Wait for input}Try it! Why don't you stand next to	me and just let your mind idle for a	little while?
"044"
"045"	I shall enjoy this wonderful town for	some time!
"046"	The balance between my head and	body may be questionable, but my	mustache is beyond reproach!{Wait for input}I'm quite particular about it.

"052"	Only a well-made {Orange}Snowman{Color Reset} can	give away bingo cards.{Wait for input}In my next life, I wish to be better	crafted so I can be a real gentleman	and hand out cards to everyone!
"053"	You must be wondering what will	happen to this hat after I'm gone.{Wait for input}Unfortunately, it melts away with	the rest of me!
"054"
"055"	It is hot{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{Wait for input} But I will not bow to	temperature! I will not break with	tradition! The hat stays on!	A hat like this is the mark of a true	gentleman.
"056"	Spring has arrived! The season of	the snowfamily has come to an end.
"057"	Spring is hot, isn't it? My mustache	zone is getting quite stuffy!
"058"	I will remain in this town only as a	lingering winter scent.{Wait for input}Oh? Not necessary, you say?{Wait for input} Well,	regardless of my intentions, I will	eventually just melt away{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.
"059"	We have been blessed this winter.{Wait for input}	On behalf of my family, I would like	to express our appreciation.	We will look forward to seeing you	next year.

"059"	Ce fut un bon hiver, avec ses	rigueurs et ses douceurs.{Wait for input}Au nom de toute ma famille, je te	remercie. Nous espérons te revoir	l'année prochaine!
