I'm sorry.
"003"	{emote: Pride}If I seemed familiar the first time	you met me,{pause 16} it's probably because I	used to do a little acting.	{emote: Flourish}Oh, they said I'd see my name in	lights before long, {pause 16}but I gave it up	for the quiet life here in {Town name (pink)}.{Player can respond (0005):0012-0000-0015-0000}	Why?	Good for you.

"011"
"012"	{emote: Worry}Well, after the show aired, {pause 16}I was	recognized everywhere I went. It	was fun at first{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}	{emote: Aggravation}But then it got really annoying! {pause 16}I	couldn't go anywhere without 	signing a cheesy picture of myself.	So{pause 8} I totally reinvented myself.{pause 16} {emote: Showmanship}New	hairstyle and everything.{pause 16} Life's been	grand ever since!	{emote: Glare}Now I just sing in the shower. {pause 16}{emote: Glee}And I	still sound fabulous!
"013"	{emote: Worry}Yeah, it's kind of a sad story.{pause 8}{emote: Aggravation} I	would have thought you'd be	interested in hearing it!
"014"	{emote: Disagreement}Well, you can't dance flamenco	without any flamenco music,{pause 8}	{Player nickname (green)}.	I only perform as part of a trio{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}	I require a qualified singer and	guitarist{pause 8} {emote: Flourish}to showcase my dancing.	{emote: Shyness}If you ever want to see me perform,{pause 8}	{emote: Agreement}please thoroughly review my	200-page contract for details.{000a-0000-0006-0f03-1000-cd00}
"015"	{emote: Soft Smile}Of course, for you{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}I might be	willing to make a small exception.{Wait for input}{emote: Showmanship}Or maybe we could go out dancing	together. {pause 16}We can do the	{000e-0004-0000}{Town name (pink)} Town Slide!
"016"	{emote: Thought}Oh, I don't suppose it would hurt	anything to show you one of my	moves.	{emote: Showmanship}{pause 32}See? {pause 8}I told you I was hot stuff. {pause 8}I'm	probably the best dancer in 	{Town name (pink)},{pause 8} don't you think?
"017"	Yeah, it's a shame.{pause 16}{emote: Anger} {capitalized}{Town name (pink)} just	doesn't have a big enough stage for	me, {catchphrase}.
"018"	Well,{pause 8} I used to think it was fun to	dress up and pretend to be	someone else.	{emote: Sunny}But one day I realized that I'm	happiest just being myself.{000a-0000-0006-1304-1400-cd00}
"019"	{emote: Soft Smile}Especially now that I have so many	good friends in {Town name (pink)}{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8} Like 	you, {Player nickname (green)}!{emote: Glee}	I know it's a little corny, {pause 8}{emote: Love}but you	guys are the best.{pause 16} I'm so happy{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}	I don't think I could even act sad!
"020"	That's why {Town name (pink)} is such a	great place to live.{pause 8} I've connected	with so many cool friends.	{emote: Soft Smile}Of course,{pause 8} you and I aren't quite	BFFs yet,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)},{pause 8} but maybe	we'll get there someday.
"021"	{emote: Sheepishness}Yeah{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}being a celebrity isn't all it's	cracked up to be. {pause 8}Who has the time	to sign autographs,{pause 8} {catchphrase}?
"022"	Of course,{pause 8} it's not an easy game to	learn.{emote: Sheepishness}{pause 16} That's probably why I'm so	good at it.
"023"	{emote: Sheepishness}If you're worried that it will be too	hard to learn how to play{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}you're	probably right.
"024"	{emote: Sheepishness}We should play sometime{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}once you	understand the rules, {pause 16}but before you	get too good!
"025"	{emote: Shocked}Wow,{pause 8} that's impressive!{pause 8} It can be	kind of scary to explore a foreign	land all by yourself.	But it's also a good way to see the	things you want{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{emote: Agreement}without worrying	about anyone else's schedule.{000a-0001-0004-001a-001b}
"026"	{emote: Happiness}I never knew you had so many	interesting stories to tell. {pause 16}We	should talk more! {capitalized}{catchphrase}!
"027"	{emote: Happiness}I think you've inspired me,	{Player nickname (green)}!{pause 16} I feel like I could pack	up right now and travel the world.
"028"	{emote: Sheepishness}Well,{pause 16} that's understandable.{pause 8} It's	easier to travel with your family or	friends.	But I have to say,{pause 8}{emote: Surprise} it can be an	eye-opening experience to visit	new places by yourself.	{emote: Agreement}I think you should try it sometime,	{Player nickname (green)}!{pause 8} You might find you're	more adventurous than you think.
"029"	{emote: Agreement}Yep, there's nothing like opening a	new book for the first time.{pause 8} The	crisp pages, {emote: Love}{pause 8}that new-book smell{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}	But don't forget to reread the	classics every now and then. {pause 8}They	always have something to offer.	{emote: Curious}Are you surprised I'm such a big	reader? You shouldn't be{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8} I'm, like,	the smartest {0005-001f-0002-cd00} in town{emote: Glare}!
"030"	Oh, me too! {emote: Joy}{pause 8}There's nothing better	than curling up with an old favorite	on the couch.	{emote: Agreement}And if it's something you haven't	read in a while, {pause 8}there's so much to	rediscover.	{emote: Inspired}That reminds me—{pause 8}I haven't read	The Saga of the {000e-0004-0000}{Player rumor}	and the {000e-0004-0000}{0005-000f-0002-0000} in ages!
"031"	{emote: Alarmed}What? {pause 16}You don't read at {0007-000a-0000}ALL?{pause 8} Oh,	{Player nickname (green)},{pause 8}{emote: Sadness} that's so disappointing	to hear!	{emote: Anger}Are you sure you don't secretly like	reading? {pause 16}It's OK,{pause 8} you know. I think	reading's cool, {emote: Pride}{pause 16}and I'm {pause 8}the coolest.
"032"	{emote: Soft Smile}That's great! {pause 8}The best time to get	out and see the world is while	you're still young.	See,{pause 8} when you're older,{pause 8} it can be	tough. {pause 8}You get used to a certain	level of comfort.	{emote: Anger}And when kids are partying all night	long in your hostel{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{emote: Aggravation}it just makes	you want to scream!	{0007-000b-0000}I NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP!{pause 16}	{emote: Disbelief}Oh! I mean{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}that could happen. {pause 8}In	theory. {pause 8}I'm sure you'll be fine.
"033"	{emote: Soft Smile}Good for you. Even if you only visit	the next town over,{pause 8} it's always a	rewarding experience.	{emote: Agreement}Of course, the farther away you	travel from {Town name (pink)},{pause 8} the more	exciting things get!	{emote: Inspired}You should try to explore as many	places as you can while you're	young,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}.	Because when you get older, {pause 8}your	priorities change. {pause 8}For example{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{Wait for input}{emote: Sheepishness}I'm here today to eat prunes and	yell at kids to stay off the lawn.{emote: Anger}{pause 32}	And I'm almost out of prunes.
"034"	{emote: Alarmed}Oh, {Player nickname (green)}, you're missing out!	There are so many sights to see,{pause 8}	people to meet, {pause 8}and foods to try!	{emote: Agreement}Trust me, {pause 8}you haven't lived until	you've tried {0005-0010-0002-0000}-	infused {0005-0013-0002-0000}!
"035"	{emote: Anger}Don't even get me started on loud	gum smackers. {pause 8}Or crunchy-chip	chewers!
"036"	{emote: Alarmed}Are you serious? {pause 8}You're one of	those infernal spaghetti slurpers?{pause 16}	{emote: Aggravation}You guys drive me nuts!	{emote: Anger}Let me give you a quick lesson.{pause 8}	First,{pause 8} twirl the spaghetti on your	fork.	Don't twirl up too much at once.{pause 8}	Only twirl an amount you can eat in	one bite.	And{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}I guess that's pretty much it.{pause 8}	{emote: Glare}Hey, I never said it was rocket 	science!
"037"	{emote: Soft Smile}Heh, {pause 8}so you know exactly how I	feel. {pause 8}On days like today, I want to	be a rebel and just buzz it all off.	{emote: Inspired}Then I can throw away my combs	and brushes and products and save	myself an hour each morning.	Ah, {pause 8}but when I have a good hair	day{emote: Joy}{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}it's all worth it, {pause 8}don't you	think?{000a-0001-0004-0026-0027}
"038"	Of course,{pause 8} the style in {Town name (pink)} is	so casual. {pause 8}{emote: Flourish}Everyone's got their own	look,{pause 8} and they rock it!	{emote: Agreement}So it's best not to let a few funky	follicles ruin your day, {pause 8}my little	tantrum notwithstanding!
"039"	{emote: Glare}Of course, it's best not to let a few	funky follicles ruin your day. {pause 8}I just	think of the old saying:	"Good hair{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}bad hair{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{emote: Laughter}I'm the one	with the activator and straight	iron!"
"040"	{emote: Alarmed}Well{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}it's good to be confident! {pause 8}Just	remember,{pause 8} looks aren't everything.{pause 8}	{emote: Agreement}You need smarts to get ahead!
"041"	{emote: Glare}Maybe I shouldn't brag, {pause 8}but I've	been named "Fastest {000e-0004-0000}{0005-001f-0002-cd00} in	{000e-0004-0000}{Town name (pink)}" for 3 years running.
"042"	{emote: Sunny}Let me know if you ever need any	running advice—{pause 8}from one speedy	girl to another. {pause 16}OK, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}?
"043"
"044"
"045"	Brr!{emote: Sigh}{pause 8} It's so cold out!{pause 8} {emote: Fearful}At least we're	getting a little snow to go with	these freezing temperatures.	{emote: Inspired}And you know what that means,	don't you, {Player nickname (green)}?{Wait for input} {emote: Joy}It's time to	make a snowman!	{emote: Disbelief}You don't know how to build one?{pause 8}	Well, it's easy. {pause 8}Just start rolling up	the snow, {pause 8}little by little.	{emote: Agreement}Be careful around the water{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}and	make one snowball at a time.{pause 8} When	they're the right size,{pause 8} stack 'em up!	I can't wait to see what kind of	snowman you'll build, {Player nickname (green)}!
"046"	You know what's really fun about	this wild weather,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}? {emote: Sunny}You	can build a snowman!	{emote: Sheepishness}Of course,{pause 8} a snowman is more	than just two snowballs stacked	on top of each other,{pause 8} you know.	{emote: Soft Smile}You can build a baby snowman,{pause 8}	a kid-sized snowman{pause 8}, or even a	giant papa snowman!	{emote: Curious}I wonder what would happen if you	made an entire snowfamily.{pause 8}	{capitalized}{catchphrase}?
"047"
"048"	You know, {pause 8}every time I eat	{0005-0013-0002-0000},{pause 8} I think of my	childhood.	{emote: Love}Nobody makes it like my mom!{pause 16} {emote: Curious}Are	there any foods that make you	nostalgic,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}?{Player can respond (0005):0031-0015-0032-0028}	Of course!	No, not really.
"049"	{emote: Delight}That's so good to hear!{pause 8} I worry	about kids who eat nothing but	frozen dinners.	{emote: Thought}So what was your favorite?{pause 8} A	classic like {0005-0013-0002-0000}?{pause 8} Or	a new twist on {0005-0013-0002-0000}?	{emote: Glare}Either way{pause 8}, hang on to that recipe!{pause 8}	It's something you can share with	your own kids when the time comes.
"050"	{emote: Worry}Oh,{pause 8} that's surprising! {pause 8}Taste and	smell usually have a way of	bringing up old memories.	I'd offer to make a traditional	{Town name (pink)} meal for you sometime{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{Wait for input}{emote: Anger}But I'm not your mother! {pause 8}Or your	father,{pause 8} for that matter! {pause 8}Dads can	cook too,{pause 8} you know.
"051"	I've been wondering, {Player nickname (green)}:	Are you really good at	{0005-0011-0002-0100}?{Player can respond (0005):0034-0000-0035-0028}	How did you know?	No, not at all.
"052"	{emote: Sheepishness}Haven't I told you before?{pause 8} I'm a	little bit psychic.{Wait for input}In all seriousness, you just have the	look of someone who has some	experience with {0005-0011-0002-0100}.	{emote: Glare}Take it as a compliment,	{Player nickname (green)}! You seem like a	sporting {fellow/gal}.
"053"	{emote: Sheepishness}Well, you should think about taking	it up.{pause 8}{emote: Glare} I know the uniform would look	good on you.
"054"	So tell me,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}, {pause 8}{emote: Curious}what kind of	clothes do you wear when you're	relaxing at home?{Player can respond (0000):0037-0000-0038-0000}	Whatever's comfy.	I keep it stylish.
"055"	{emote: Agreement}Me too.{pause 8} I just don't feel like putting	on fancy clothes when I'm going to	sit around and eat popcorn.	{emote: Worry}You won't tell anyone, {pause 8}will you? {pause 8}I	have a reputation to maintain!
"056"	{emote: Shocked}Really?{pause 8} Who are you trying to	impress?{Wait for input}{emote: Anger}Don't get me wrong—{pause 8}sweatpants	are not meant to be seen in public.{pause 16}	But they're fine for a lazy day in.
"057"	{000a-0001-0004-003a-003b}
"058"	{emote: Curious}This might seem like a weird	question, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)},{pause 8} but do you	ever wear makeup?{Player can respond (0005):003c-0015-003d-0028}	Yes, once in a while.	No, never.
"059"	{emote: Soft Smile}OK, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}, {pause 8}from one girl to 	another: {pause 8}do you usually wear	makeup?{Player can respond (0005):003e-0015-003f-0028}	Yes, I do.	Not usually.
"060"	{emote: Thought}Well,{pause 8} there's nothing wrong with	that. {pause 16}It's {Year}.{pause 16} Boys are wearing	makeup.{pause 16}{emote: Pride} I say {pause 16}deal with it!	{emote: Laughter}Just don't put too much foundation	and self tanner on,{pause 8} or you'll look like	a news anchor.
"061"	{emote: Agreement}Well, you've got really nice skin and	a good complexion. {pause 8}I'm jealous!{Wait for input}Of course, {pause 8}more and more men are	wearing makeup these days.{pause 8} {emote: Happiness}Nothing	wrong with trying to look good!
"062"	{emote: Agreement}Me too.{pause 8} It's nice to add a little	sparkle or some color when you're	feeling flat.	{emote: Joy}But nothing radiates beauty like a	pretty smile and kind eyes.{pause 8} Don't	you agree, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}?
"063"	{emote: Alarmed}Wow, you look great{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}and so	natural! {pause 8}I'm jealous of your	complexion.	{emote: Mischief}You'll have to share your skin-care	routine with me sometime.{pause 8} OK,{pause 8}	{Player nickname (green)}?
