"032"	First of all,{pause 10} this is the entrance.{Wait for input}There are three exhibition areas for	you to view—{pause 5}one to the left, one to	the right, and one in the back.	{emote: Happiness}You can reference the {Blue}Touch Screen	{Color Reset}for a detailed map!

We'll deliver it to you later!
"034"	{emote: Thought}Lastly,{pause 10} I've got one more important	thing to tell you{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{Wait for input}{emote: Worry}If you see someone suspicious or	find a model home that's not	appropriate for public display{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.	{emote: Reset}please ask the person to leave, or	go to the model home and request	it be removed from the area.	{emote: Happiness}Once you've done that, we'll take	care of the rest as soon as we can!

"039"	{emote: Happiness}Some home construction has also	recently taken place,{pause 10} so be sure	to go have a look!
"041"	{emote: Happiness}Well, hello there!{pause 15} Can I assist you	with anything at this time?{000f-0007-0008-0000-0000-0000-0028}	I'd like to go home.	Current model home.	I have a question!	Nope, nothing.
"042"	I see.{pause 10} {emote: Happiness}Well, I'll be here if ever you	need me!
"043"	{emote: Happiness}You'd like to know about the data	provided from this town to other	HHA members, is that right?
"044"	Currently,{pause 5} your house is being shown	as the model home representing	{Town name (pink)}. And I thank you for it!
"045"	If you'd like to show the house of	another member from this town...{Wait for input}that member would have to come	here personally so we can go	through the necessary procedures!
"046"	{emote: Thought}Currently,{pause 10} {0011-0000-0002-0000}'s house is	the model being shown to represent	{Town name (pink)}{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.	{emote: Reset}Would you like to change it so your	{emote: Curious}house is shown as the model home?{pause 10}{confirmation-02}{000f-0005-0004-0015-0028}	Yes, please!	No, leave it as is.
"047"	Of course. Understood!{Wait for input}	{emote: Happiness}I'll just leave the status quo.{pause 5}
"048"	Excellent. Understood!{Wait for input}	{emote: Happiness}I'll make the arrangements!{pause 5}
"049"	{emote: Sunny}Thank you for your patience!{Wait for input}	{emote: Reset}From now on, your house will	be shown as the model home!	{emote: Happiness}I hope many members get to see it!
"050"
"051"
"052"
"053"	{emote: Curious}What would you like to hear about?{000f-0008-000a-0000-0000-0000-0000-0028}	This town's model.	Other model homes.	Ordering furniture.	Blocking users.	Never mind.
"054"	{emote: Curious}Would you like to hear about	anything else?{000f-0008-000a-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000}	This town's model.	Other model homes.	Ordering furniture.	Blocking users.	No, thank you.
"055"	From each town,{pause 10} there's one model	home representing the town, and it	gets shown to everyone!	If you'd like to change the house	representing your town, the	process is fairly simple.	Whoever wants to have their home	represent {Town name (pink)} just needs to	come speak to me about it.
"056"	In our showcase, there's enough	space to accommodate up to 48	model homes!	When we run out of open space,{pause 10} the	newer model homes will replace the	old ones in order.	If you'd like to keep displaying a	specific house,{pause 10} be sure to use the	{Blue}Mark as favorite{Color Reset} option!{pause 5}	{emote: Happiness}If you want to move a model home	to or from your favorites, use the	sign in front of it.	{emote: Reset}But{pause 10} keep in mind you can only	mark up to 16 homes as your	favorites.{pause 5} No more than that!
"057"	{emote: Happiness}You're free to look inside the model	homes here all you like.{Wait for input}{emote: Reset}Plus,{pause 5} excluding some exceptions,{pause 5}	you can purchase the furniture in	the homes via mail-order service!	If you'd like to buy an item, simply	order it from the {Blue}Touch Screen{Color Reset}	while you're in the house.
"058"	{emote: Worry}If you find someone suspicious{pause 10}	or a model home that's rather	inappropriate for public display{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.	{emote: Reset}be sure to ask that person to leave.{pause 10}{Wait for input}You can also check the sign next to	the home and request that it no	longer be displayed in our town.	When doing so,{pause 10} you can choose if	the offensive person or home should	be removed temporarily or forever.	If the user is removed temporarily,{pause 10}	he or she can return once you tag	them via StreetPass again.	If you choose to {Blue}block {Color Reset}the user	forever, well, that's quite different.{Wait for input}He or she won't be displayed in the	showcase ever again, even if you	tag them in the future.	Please be aware that it may prevent	you from seeing that same player's	content in other games as well.

"055"	Por cada pueblo hay una casa	de exposición{pause 10} que lo representa	y se muestra para todo el mundo.	Elegir una casa distinta para	representar a este pueblo{pause 10} es	un proceso bien sencillito.

En tal caso,{pause 10} puedes elegir que	esa persona se retire de forma	temporal o permanente.	Si quieres que sea temporalmente,{pause 10}	puede volver si te la encuentras	mediante StreetPass.	Bloquear a alguien de manera	permanente ya es otro cantar.{Wait for input}No podrá volver a la exposición	nunca más por mucho que te la	encuentres.	Ten en cuenta que tal decisión	puede impedir que veas su	contenido en otros juegos.

"044"	Actuellement,{pause 5} ta maison est	exposée et représente fièrement	{Town name (pink)}.	Nous te remercions pour ta	confiance!
"045"	Si tu veux exposer la maison d'un	autre habitant de cette ville...{Wait for input}... son propriétaire devra se	présenter ici en personne pour que	nous puissions faire le nécessaire!
"046"	{emote: Thought}Actuellement,{pause 10} c'est la maison	{de /d'}{0011-0000-0002-0000} qui représente	{Town name (pink)}{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.	{emote: Curious}Veux-tu que ta maison soit exposée	à la place de la sienne?{pause 10}{confirmation-02}{000f-0005-0004-0015-0028}	Oui, s'il te plaît!

"056"	Nous pouvons exposer jusqu'à 48	maisons-témoins dans notre village!{Wait for input}Quand la place vient à manquer,{pause 10}	nous remplaçons les maisons les	plus anciennes par les nouvelles.	Si tu veux t'assurer qu'une maison	reste exposée,{pause 10} pense à l'ajouter à la	liste de tes {Blue}maisons favorites{Color Reset}!	{emote: Happiness}Pour ce faire, examine simplement	le panneau posé devant la maison-	témoin de ton choix!	{emote: Reset}Mais{pause 10} n'oublie pas que tu ne peux	faire figurer que 16 maisons dans ta	liste.{pause 5} Pas une de plus!

Pour passer une commande, utilise	l'{Blue}écran tactile {Color Reset}lorsque que tu te	trouves à l'intérieur d'une maison.
"058"	{emote: Worry}Si jamais tu rencontres un individu	suspect, {pause 10}{emote: Reset}n'hésite pas à lui demander	de partir{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.	De même, si une maison semble ne	pas convenir à une exposition en	public, demande sa démolition.	Tu peux alors choisir de bloquer	l'utilisateur mis en cause	temporairement ou pour toujours.	Si celui-ci n'est bloqué que	temporairement, ça signifie que tu	pourras le recroiser via StreetPass.	Si tu choisis de {Blue}bloquer {Color Reset}l'utilisateur	définitivement, eh bien, c'est une	autre histoire.{Wait for input}Il ne pourra alors plus jamais venir	au village-témoin, même si tu le	croises à nouveau.	Mais sache que ça t'empêchera	aussi de voir tout contenu créé par	cet utilisateur dans d'autres jeux.
