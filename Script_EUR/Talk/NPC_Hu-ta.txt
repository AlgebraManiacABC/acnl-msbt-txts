"001"	{emote: Bashful}Oh dear. {pause 5}Pardon me...
"002"	{emote: Distress}Hoo! {pause 5}I'm a bit of a night owl.	Drowsy in the daytime, you see!

"004"	{pause 20}Welcome to the	{000e-0004-0000}{Town name (pink)} Museum.
"005"	Take your time...{pause 10} Do look around...
"006"	{emote: Happiness}Our museum is second to none, may	I humbly say. {pause 10}Brimming with fish!{pause 5}	Chock full of fossils!	And blessed with every work of art!{pause 10}	{emote: Joy}Yes, the {Town name (pink)} museum is	extraordinary. {pause 5}Hootie hoo!

"009"	{emote: Happiness}Our aquarium is truly outstanding!	Indeed, {pause 5}we reel in visitors from	far and wide.	So please be sure to enjoy our	fascinating fish. I think you'll	get along, {pause 5}if I may, {pause 5}swimmingly.

"012"	{emote: Happiness}Our museum is nearly full. {pause 5}It brims	with fish, {pause 5}and I wouldn't say it's	infested with insects, {pause 5}but it's close.	Yet if it's portraits or fossils you	seek, {pause 5}those exhibits are nearing	completion too. Enjoy them all.
"013"	{emote: Happiness}Our museum is filling up, I'll have	you know. {pause 5}Yes, we've been	feathering this nest quite nicely.	So if you're in the mood for this or	that, you'll be sure to find it.{pause 5}	Visitors always leave quite satisfied.

"083"	Why, Mayor! {pause 10}I was just trying my	best to solve a dilemma. But I must	admit, I'm fairly stuck.	Oh! {emote: Inspired}May I ask your thoughts on	the matter?
"084"	{emote: Reset}Though our collection has grown,	our museum just isn't drawing the	attendance I hoped for.	I know the very thing that will bring	more visitors, of course.{Wait for input}	{emote: Inspired}The museum must be remodeled!	{emote: Happiness}We have a second floor that is going	unused at the moment.

"085"	{emote: Worry}Now {pause 5}my dilemma:{pause 20} As the director	here, I have big dreams for our	museum{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 10}but no Bells.	{emote: Disagreement}I don't have the funds to remodel	the museum.{Wait for input}{emote: Reset} But, Mayor,{pause 8} this place	is a public service, so perhaps{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.	maybe we could have this added to	the list of {Blue}public works projects{Color Reset} for	the town?	{emote: Agreement}Would you consider making this a	priority for {Town name (pink)}?{pause 8} As mayor,	you can make this dream come true!	{emote: Happiness}I'll tell your secretary, {Orange}Isabelle{Color Reset},	in case you'd like to help out.{pause 20}	{emote: Agreement}My thanks in advance, Mayor.{000d-0000-0002-cd06}

"092"	This time my dilemma involves a	friend. {pause 10}{emote: Agreement}Truth be told, an old	acquaintance named {Orange}Brewster{Color Reset}.	He is a master coffee brewer.{pause 8}	{emote: Sadness}But this fellow has no place where	he can put his skills to use!	{emote: Thought}So why not open a café here in	{Town name (pink)}?

"093"	{emote: Reset}Of course, {emote: Soft Smile}we now come to the	problem.

"083"	Salve, sindaco! {pause 10}Sto tentando di	trovare una soluzione a un dilemma,	ma per ora senza successo.	{emote: Inspired}Potrei chiedere la tua opinione	in merito, uh?
"084"	{emote: Reset}Sebbene le nostre collezioni si siano	arricchite, il museo non riesce	ad attrarre abbastanza visitatori.	So bene cosa dovremmo fare per	aumentare il numero di visite...{Wait for input}	Dobbiamo ristrutturare l'edificio!	{emote: Happiness}Sai, abbiamo un primo piano che	attualmente è in disuso. Potremmo	usarlo per allestire nuove sale!	Ho un'idea: creare uno spazio dove	chiunque {000e-0010-0000} {Town name (pink)} possa	esporre quello che vuole! Uuuh!
"085"	{emote: Worry}Ora, {pause 5}ecco il mio dilemma. Come	direttore, ho tante speranze per	questo museo...{pause 10} ma zero stelline.	{emote: Disagreement}Purtroppo non ci sono fondi	per ampliare il museo.{Wait for input} Ma visto che	si tratta di un{Blue} servizio pubblico{Color Reset}...	{emote: Agreement}... non potresti, come sindaco,	includere questo lavoro nella lista	delle {Blue}opere pubbliche{Color Reset} della città?	{emote: Happiness}Andrò al municipio per parlarne	con {Orange}Fuffi{Color Reset}, la tua segretaria.

"092"	Questa volta, il mio problema	riguarda un amico. {pause 10}{emote: Agreement}A dire il vero,	un amico di vecchia data.	È un eccellente {Blue}barista{Color Reset}, ma non ha	un posto in cui mettere la sua	bravura al servizio della comunità.	{emote: Thought}Per cui pensavo... perché non aprire	una caffetteria qui {000e-0010-0000} {Town name (pink)}?	I visitatori l'apprezzerebbero molto.	{emote: Happiness}Un caffè tra una collezione e l'altra	{pause 5}potrebbe aiutarli a restare svegli!{pause 5}	Uuuh uh!
"093"	{emote: Reset}Fin qui tutto bene. {emote: Soft Smile}Il punto è che	non posso certo mettere su	una caffetteria da solo.	{emote: Agreement}Sono certo che il mio amico sarebbe	amato da tutti i cittadini. Fa il caffè	migliore del mondo, te lo garantisco.	{emote: Sigh}Ma purtroppo non ho la bacchetta	magica per rendere questo sogno	realtà.{pause 10} Sigh... Che fare?
"094"	{emote: Surprise}E qui entri in scena tu...{Wait for input}	{emote: Happiness}Uuuh, sei il nostro sindaco!{pause 5}	Tu hai quella bacchetta magica!	Ogni città che si rispetti ha una	caffetteria dove bere un caffè fatto	per bene. Perché non {Town name (pink)}?{pause 10}	{emote: Happiness}Questo progetto deve andare	in porto.{pause 10} Andrò al municipio per	parlarne alla tua assistente, uh.	Il destino della caffetteria, e	anche {pause 5}quello del mio amico, {pause 5}è	nelle tue mani, sindaco. {pause 10}Ci conto!{000d-0000-0002-cd06}

"001"	{emote: Bashful}Verzeihung...
"002"	{emote: Distress}Uhuuu! {pause 5}Als Nachteule bin ich	tagsüber immer etwas schläfrig,	müssen Sie wissen!
"003"	{emote: Happiness}Uhuuu! Ich heiße Sie im Museum	von {Town name (pink)} willkommen.
"004"	{emote: Happiness}Willkommen im Museum	von {Town name (pink)}.
"005"	Sehen Sie sich in aller Ruhe um.
"006"	{emote: Happiness}Bei aller Bescheidenheit...{pause 10}	Ein besseres Museum als dieses	werden Sie vergeblich suchen.	Wir haben die weltgrößte Auswahl	an Fischen und Fossilien und sind	reichlich mit Kunstwerken gesegnet!	{emote: Joy}Ja, das Museum von {Town name (pink)}	ist etwas ganz Besonderes. {pause 5}Uhuuu!
"007"	{emote: Happiness}Unsere Sammlungen sind wirklich	äußerst umfangreich.{pause 10}	Genießen Sie Ihren Besuch!
"008"	{emote: Happiness}Unsere Insektensammlung sucht	ihresgleichen. {pause 10}Sie zieht regelrecht	Besucherschwärme an.	Berauschen Sie sich an unserer	Ausstellung und, {pause 5}wenn ich Sie bitten	darf, {pause 5}empfehlen Sie uns weiter.
"009"	{emote: Happiness}Unsere Aquarien sind wahrlich	bemerkenswert!{pause 10} Damit angeln wir	uns Besucher von nah und fern.	In unseren Räumen werden Sie sich	wohlfühlen wie ein Fisch im Wasser,	{pause 15}wenn ich das so sagen darf.
"010"	{emote: Happiness}Die umfassende Fossilienausstellung	in diesem Museum ist alles andere	als trocken und verstaubt. 	Mehr Dinosaurier werden Sie,{pause 30} ohne	Zeitmaschine zumindest, {pause 30}nirgendwo	zu sehen bekommen.
"011"	{emote: Happiness}Unsere Kunstausstellung ist, {pause 30}wenn	ich das sagen darf, {pause 30}ein Ausbund	an Perfektion.	Bitte, {pause 5}lassen Sie den Zauber dieser	makellosen Sammlung auf sich	wirken.{pause 10} Ein Fest für die Augen!
"012"	{emote: Happiness}Unser Museum ist fast voll.{pause 10}	Beinahe könnte man meinen, es sei	regelrecht befallen von Insekten.	Auch wenn Sie an Fossilien, Fischen	oder Gemälden interessiert sind,	finden Sie hier eine reiche Auswahl.
"013"	{emote: Happiness}Unser Museum füllt sich so langsam.{pause 10}	Ja, in letzter Zeit sind einige	Ausstellungsstücke hinzugekommen.	Wonach Sie auch suchen mögen, Sie	werden von allem etwas finden und	Ihren Besuch nicht bereuen.
"014"	{emote: Happiness}Unsere Sammlung befindet sich	noch im Aufbau,{pause 5} aber sie ist bereits	groß genug, um Sie zu begeistern.	Dieses Museum ist wie ein Küken,	das seine ersten Schritte macht. {pause 5}	Begleiten Sie uns auf unserem Weg!
"015"	Obwohl unsere Sammlung langsam	Gestalt annimmt, {pause 5}ist es noch ein	weiter Weg für dieses Museum.	Doch die eine oder andere	Entdeckung,{pause 5} da bin ich mir sicher,{pause 5}	erwartet Sie bei uns bereits.
"016"	Womit kann ich dienen?{pause 10}	Unvollständige Sammlungen?{pause 10}	Langweilige Ausstellungen?	Nun, {pause 5}ehrlich gesagt haben wir noch	kein einziges Ausstellungsstück.{pause 10}	Trotzdem herzlich willkommen!
"017"
"018"	{emote: Happiness}Werfen Sie bitte auch einen Blick	in unseren Laden im Obergeschoss.{pause 5}	Sie werden es nicht bereuen!
"019"	{emote: Happiness}Besuchen Sie auch unsere Räume	für Sonderausstellungen und den	Museumsladen im Obergeschoss!
"020"	{emote: Happiness}Des Weiteren finden Sie im	Obergeschoss unsere Ausstellung	„{0012-0007-0002-cd00}“. 
"021"	Im Obergeschoss finden zurzeit	übrigens zwei Sonderausstellungen	statt.	„{capitalized}{0012-0007-0002-cd00}“ und	„{0012-0007-0002-cd01}“ sind beide	gleichermaßen sehenswert!
"022"	Im Übrigen haben wir im Ober-	geschoss zurzeit gleich drei	Sonderausstellungen.	„{capitalized}{0012-0007-0002-cd00}“ und	„{0012-0007-0002-cd01}“ sind	auf jeden Fall einen Besuch wert.	Aber auch „{0012-0007-0002-cd02}“	ist nicht zu verachten.{pause 10} Sehen Sie	sich am besten gleich alle drei an!
"023"	Im Obergeschoss haben wir	derzeit übrigens ganze vier	Sonderausstellungen.	„{capitalized}{0012-0007-0002-cd00}“ und	„{0012-0007-0002-cd01}“ sollten	Sie sich unbedingt ansehen.	Aber auch „{0012-0007-0002-cd02}“	und „{0012-0007-0002-cd03}“ sind	ganz wunderbare Ausstellungen.
"024"	{emote: Alarmed}{pause 15}Huuu! {pause 10}Sind Sie nicht {der neue/die neue}	{Bürgermeister/Bürgermeisterin}?
"025"	{emote: Happiness}Ich bin {Orange}Eugen{Color Reset}, der Direktor	dieses Museums.{pause 10} Es ist mir eine	Ehre, Ihre Bekanntschaft zu machen.

"026"	{emote: Reset}Im Großen und Ganzen {pause 5}ist das alles. {pause 10}	Sehen Sie?{pause 5} Ich habe es mit wenigen	Worten auf den Punkt gebracht.	{emote: Happiness}Nur noch ein klitzekleiner Nachtrag,{pause 5}	wenn Sie erlauben:{Wait for input}Im Obergeschoss befinden sich ein	Museumsladen sowie ein Raum für	Gastausstellungen.
"027"	{emote: Worry}Im Moment haben wir jedoch ein	kleines Problem.{pause 10} Die Zahl unserer	Exponate beträgt...{pause 20} null!	{emote: Sheepishness}Huuu, das ist mir wirklich peinlich.{pause 20}	{emote: Happiness}Aber vielleicht können Sie uns	helfen?{Wait for input} Ja, {pause 5}das können Sie!	Und zwar, indem Sie dem Museum	neue Ausstellungsstücke zur	Verfügung stellen!	In diesem Fall wäre ich Ihnen stell-	vertretend für ganz {Town name (pink)} zu	allerherzlichstem Dank verpflichtet.

Ein Museum ist immer nur so groß	wie die Herzen seiner Unterstützer.{pause 10}	Vielen herzlichen Dank!

"082"	...{pause 10}Oh!{emote: Alarmed}{Wait <002d 0000> 'time'}
"083"	{Herr Bürgermeister/Frau Bürgermeisterin}! {pause 10}	Unser Museum befindet sich derzeit	in einer überaus misslichen Lage.	{emote: Inspired}Dürfte ich Sie hierzu wohl nach	Ihrer geschätzten Meinung fragen?
"084"	{emote: Reset}Obwohl unsere Sammlung größer	geworden ist, hat unser Museum	weniger Besucher als erhofft.	Die Lösung dieses Problems liegt	für mich auf der Kralle:{Wait for input} Das Museum	sollte umgestaltet werden!	{emote: Happiness}Da das Obergeschoss derzeit	leer steht, habe ich mir überlegt,	wie man es nutzen könnte.	Meine Idee sind Räume, in denen	jeder in {Town name (pink)} Platz für seine	ganz individuelle Ausstellung hat!
"085"	{emote: Worry}Nun zu meinem Problem. {pause 10}Als	Museumsdirektor mag ich zwar	Visionen haben, {pause 20}aber keine Sternis.	{emote: Disagreement}Mir fehlen einfach die Mittel für	eine derartige Umgestaltung.{Wait for input}Aber da es sich bei diesem Museum 	um eine {Blue}öffentliche Einrichtung	{Color Reset}handelt...	{emote: Agreement}Könnten Sie als {Bürgermeister/Bürgermeisterin}	eventuell dafür sorgen, dass mein	Vorschlag umgesetzt werden kann?	{emote: Happiness}Ich werde umgehend Ihre Assistentin	{Orange}Melinda{Color Reset} von der Sache in Kenntnis	setzen.{pause 20} {emote: Agreement}Vielen Dank im Voraus.{000d-0000-0002-cd06}

"092"	Diesmal geht es um einen guten	Freund von mir. {pause 10}{emote: Agreement}Oder besser gesagt,	um einen alten Bekannten.	Er ist ein meisterhafter {Blue}Kaffeewirt{Color Reset}.{pause 10}	Ihm fehlt jedoch ein Ort, an dem er	dieser Berufung nachgehen kann.	{emote: Thought}Also habe ich mich gefragt, ob	wir nicht hier in {Town name (pink)} ein	Café eröffnen sollten.	{emote: Happiness}Die Leute würden es lieben!{pause 10}	Denken Sie nur an den Imagegewinn,	der damit für uns einherginge!
"093"	{emote: Reset}Doch nun zum eigentlichen Problem.{pause 20}	{emote: Soft Smile}Für eine derartige Investition fehlen	einer armen Eule einfach die Mittel.	{emote: Agreement}Auch wenn ich für die Qualität	seiner Kaffeespezialitäten die	Kralle ins Feuer lege...	{emote: Sigh}Ich kann den Wunsch meines	Bekannten,{pause 5} und somit auch meinen	eigenen Wunsch,{pause 5} nicht erfüllen.
"094"	{emote: Surprise}Dabei steht die Antwort in diesem	Moment direkt vor mir.{Wait for input}	{emote: Happiness}Sie, {Herr Bürgermeister/Frau Bürgermeisterin}!	Ein {Blue}Café{Color Reset} wäre für {Town name (pink)} eine	echte Bereicherung!{pause 10} Jede Stadt	sollte eines ihr Eigen nennen.	{emote: Happiness}Ja, ich bin restlos überzeugt von	diesem Plan. {pause 10}Ich werde sofort Ihre	Assistentin im Rathaus einweihen.	Das Schicksal des Cafés, {pause 5}wie auch	das meines Bekannten, {pause 5}liegt in Ihren	Händen, {Herr Bürgermeister/Frau Bürgermeisterin}!{000d-0000-0002-cd06}
