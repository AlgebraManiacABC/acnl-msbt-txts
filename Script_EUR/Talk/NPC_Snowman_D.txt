"041"	Have you already met my family?{Wait for input}It may seem as though we lack a{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 20}	cohesive theme. But that's not the	case when we're in our other form.
"042"	I may not look it now, but I was	quite the slim gentleman in my	younger years.	But once I became a family man, I	began gaining weight. And now I	have quite an impressive waistline.
"043"	Standing all day is not as much	of a chore as you might imagine.{Wait for input}Try it! Why don't you stand next to	me and just let your mind idle for a	little while?
"044"
"045"	I shall enjoy this wonderful town for	some time!
"046"	The balance between my head and	body may be questionable, but my	mustache is beyond reproach!{Wait for input}I'm quite particular about it.

"051"	What do you think is the mark of a	truly mature adult?{Wait for input} If you ask me, I	would say it's perseverance.	Perseverance through the cold.{pause 40}	Perseverance in standing around.{pause 40}	Perseverance through unbalance{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.
"052"	Only a well-made {Orange}Snowman{Color Reset} can	give away bingo cards.{Wait for input}In my next life, I wish to be better	crafted so I can be a real gentleman	and hand out cards to everyone!
"053"	You must be wondering what will	happen to this hat after I'm gone.{Wait for input}Unfortunately, it melts away with	the rest of me!
"054"
"055"	It is hot{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{Wait for input} But I will not bow to	temperature! I will not break with	tradition! The hat stays on!	A hat like this is the mark of a true	gentleman.
"056"	Spring has arrived! The season of	the snowfamily has come to an end.
"057"	Spring is hot, isn't it? My mustache	zone is getting quite stuffy!
"058"	I will remain in this town only as a	lingering winter scent.{Wait for input}Oh? Not necessary, you say?{Wait for input} Well,	regardless of my intentions, I will	eventually just melt away{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.
"059"	On behalf of my family,{Wait for input} I would like	to express our appreciation for all	you've done for us this winter.	We will look forward to seeing you	again in the future!
"060"	Wonderful{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 20} Spring, though it is so	much different than winter, is also a	splendid season.

"037"	La primavera è una stagione così	gioiosa! Direi che è semplicemente	splendida!{Wait for input}Ti potrà forse sembrare strano,	ma è quella che preferisco	dopo l'inverno.
"038"	Le cartelle della cinquina scadono	in primavera.{Wait for input} Per ricominciare,	dovrai aspettare l'anno successivo.
"039"	Ti siamo davvero grati.{Wait for input}	Vorrei infatti ringraziarti	a nome di tutta la mia famiglia.	Dovremo cercare di incontrarci	di nuovo l'anno prossimo!
"040"
"041"	Hai già incontrato la mia famiglia?{Wait for input}Potrebbe sembrare che siamo{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 20}	un po' freddi. Ma non è certo	colpa nostra...
"042"	Adesso ormai non è più così, ma	ai miei tempi ero un gentiluomo	molto affascinante.	Da quando sono un padre di famiglia	non mi curo più come una volta. Ma	non rinuncio al mio naso di carota.
"043"	Stare in piedi tutto il giorno non	è così pesante come potresti	immaginare.{Wait for input}Provaci! Perché non rimani	un po' con me e ti rilassi	senza fare niente?
"044"
"045"	Mi godrò questa città meravigliosa	per un po' di tempo!
"046"	Forse le proporzioni tra la mia	testa e il resto del corpo non	sono le migliori, ma i miei baffi...{Wait for input}... sono perfetti e me ne vanto!

"049"
"050"	Avrei dovuto dire qualcosa durante	il processo di costruzione	del mio corpo{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{Wait for input}Un semplice "troppo grande" o	"troppo piccolo" avrebbe potuto	fare la differenza.{Wait for input}Peccato! Senza testa non	potevo certo parlare.
"051"	Qual è, secondo te, un segno	di maturità?{Wait for input} Secondo me è	la resistenza.	Resistenza al freddo.{pause 40} Resistenza	allo stare immobile.{pause 40} Resistenza	a questa forma senza equilibrio{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.
"052"	I pupazzi di neve tali e quali a me	possono regalare cartelle della	cinquina solo se sono ben fatti.{Wait for input}Nella mia prossima vita, spero di	essere costruito meglio, per dare	cartelle a tutti come un gentiluomo.
"053"	Forse ti starai chiedendo che cosa	succederà a questo cappello quando	me ne sarò andato.{Wait for input}Sfortunatamente, si scioglierà	insieme a me!
"054"
"055"	Fa caldo{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{Wait for input} ma non mi arrenderò!	Rimarrò fedele alla tradizione!	Continuerò a portare il cappello!	Un cappello come questo è	il marchio di un vero gentiluomo.
"056"	La primavera è arrivata! La stagione	della famiglia di neve è giunta	al termine.
"057"	La primavera è calda, vero? La zona	dei baffi sta diventando un po'	appiccicosa.
"058"	Rimarrò in questa città per	ricordare a tutti la magia	dell'inverno.{Wait for input}Oh? Tu dici che non è necessario?{Wait for input}	Beh, nonostante le mie intenzioni,	finirò con lo sciogliermi{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.
"059"	Quest'inverno siamo stati fortunati.{Wait for input}	A nome di tutta la mia famiglia,	vorrei ringraziarti.	Non vediamo l'ora di rivederti	il prossimo inverno.
"060"	Che meraviglia{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 20} La primavera,	anche se è così diversa dall'inverno,	è comunque una stagione splendida.
"061"
"062"
"063"	Allora, vediamo un po'.{Wait for input} Ce l'hai	questo numero sulla cartella?
