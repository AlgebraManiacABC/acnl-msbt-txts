"001"	These fish are so small, they can	fit their entire body in the palm	of your hand.	During mating season, the male's	belly turns a light orange in order	to properly attract a mate.	They live in rivers and lakes and	deposit eggs in large bivalves where	the eggs hatch and live for a while.
"002"	These fish are related to carp, with	distinguishing features such as long	ventral fins and protruding mouths.	They have good jumping abilities,	which allow them to jump up and	grab bugs hanging around the water.	They are known as very active fish	with rather scrappy attitudes,	making them tenacious survivors.	During mating season, the male's	stomach turns pink and its back	turns blue. Females love this.
"003"	Crucian carp are fairly easy fish for	beginners to catch, but they're also	popular with veteran anglers.	They are related to koi and can live	up to 15 years, making them a great	fish to keep in a pond.	Male offspring are seldom born,	so females significantly outnumber	males, making populations suffer.	Luckily, females can reproduce with	males of some other species, so the	problem is relatively temporary.
"004"	Dace can live in cloudier, murkier	water than most but are easy to see	as their numbers are so plentiful.	They are related to carp, and	some species of dace live in the	ocean as well as rivers and streams.	During mating season, the bellies of	the males develop an orange stripe	to indicate their intent to mate.
"005"	Barbel steeds have a longer	distance between their eyes and	mouths than carp do.	This makes them look almost like	they're averting their eyes	downward in embarrassment.	Their whiskers aren't as long as	carp whiskers, so the resemblance	is still only minor.	They are full of bones, but they're	edible nonetheless and actually	taste similar to flounder.
"006"	These tough fish have very long	life spans, capping out at ages	surpassing 100 years.	Their whiskers are one of their	trademark features, making them	relatively easy to identify.	They're omnivorous and eat	waterweed and bugs by sucking	their food into their mouths.	They also have teeth in the back	of their throats that help break	down shellfish for digestion.
"007"	Though typically pale in color, these	aquarium fish also can be found	with rather beautiful patterns.	This is all thanks to very selective	breeding of carp with genetic	mutations, allowing for diversity.	No two koi have the exact same	pattern and are popularly known	as "swimming jewels" as a result.	They can be sold for a very high	price, depending on their coloring	and pattern.	If properly cared for, they can live	for over 100 years, making them a	staple for outdoor garden ponds.
"008"	These are aquarium fish that came	about by selectively breeding types	of crucian carp.	It took hundreds of years to get the	long tail fin and beautiful color of	the current breed.	Even red goldfish are black when	they are young and still retain some	other vestiges of the crucian carp.	They turn red as they grow, thus	gaining their much more commonly	known look.
"009"	They're known for their protruding	eyes, as the name indicates, but this	feature is actually a detriment.	Their vision is quite poor, to the	point that they will swim past food	and frequently bump into things.	They are a type of goldfish and get	their distinguishing eye pop about	two months after birth.
"010"	Killifish are small, travel in schools,	and are known for having eyes	higher up on their faces than others.	They swim in shallow areas in rivers	and mostly eat bugs that float on	the surface of the water.	This is why they have mouths as	high up their faces as their eyes,	making them effective hunters.	Being the same temperature as the	water they inhabit, getting grabbed	by warm hands can shock them.
"011"	These shrimp relatives are usually	found in ponds and rivers, typically	making them easy to catch.	The reason for this strange habitat	is that crawfish are plentiful and	will eat just about anything.	Eating plant material makes their	bodies red, but only eating fish and	meat will turn their bodies blue.	A red color indicates they are	eating a healthy and balanced diet,	so red is the ideal for the species.
"012"	These relatives of common turtles	will not let go when they decide to	bite down on something.	Although they can be quite shy, 	they will become a bit aggressive	when threatened.	They are often found in water and	are very good swimmers because of	the flat shape of their shells.	They swim with their snouts over	the surface of the water so they	can breathe.	Soft-shelled turtles aren't safe to	hold because they are so prone to	biting at the slightest movement.	However, if one bites down on you,	it will usually let go when you put	it safely back in the water.
"013"	Tadpoles are nothing more than	baby frogs and generally inhabit	ponds and streams.	Their round heads and quirky style	of movement give them a different	kind of cuteness from adult frogs.	They become more frog-like when	they eventually grow legs and start	to lose their tails.	Unlike fish, though, their skin is very	delicate because they do not have	scales, so handle carefully.
"014"	These former tadpoles prefer to	live near ponds and other damp and	swampy places.	They dwell on land, so they have	lungs and skin as opposed to a set	of gills.	They like to stick close to water	because they require a nice, moist	lifestyle.	Frogs are moist because they emit	a liquid to protect their skin from	dryness.	If too much moisture evaporates	from their thin skins, they could	have trouble breathing.	It's better not to handle frogs, as	some species are poisonous, even	to the touch!
"015"	These short and stocky river-	dwelling fish have a lot of slender	teeth for tearing apart other fish.	Freshwater gobies dig holes under	rocks in riverbeds to make nests	for eggs, which the males guard.	Other fish breeds take advantage of	this protective quality and often lay	eggs in goby nests.
"016"	Loaches are rather small fish that	make their habitats in rivers and	muddy water.	They have 10 whiskers around their	mouths with taste buds built in for	tasting sweetness and bitterness.	Loaches can breathe through their	intestines as well as their gills—a	rather unique quality of the species.	They push their mouths above the	surface of the water to inhale,	exhaling through their tail regions.	Making stew with loaches and	burdock root is known to improve	stamina, or so people believe.
"017"	Catfish are known for their long	whiskers, wide bodies, and large	mouths, but they don't have fur.	Despite having large eyes, they have	rather poor eyesight. They make up	for this with sensory whiskers.	Catfish have small horizontal and	vertical lines in their bodies, almost	like perforated lines.	These holes are for detecting weak	electric currents of other fish,	making them adept hunters.	Catfish are artful carnivores as	they swim around lazily but then	strike quickly when prey is found.
"018"	Eels are born in the ocean but swim	upstream through rivers when they	become adults.	They do, however, eventually swim	back to the ocean when it is time	to lay eggs.	Their blood can be toxic, which	is why you've never heard of eel	sashimi. It's just too dangerous.	Cooked eel, however, is edible and	has no poisonous effects to speak	of, making it a popular dish.	For a long time, the egg-laying	locations and habits of eels were	largely a mystery.	However, they are gradually being	revealed through research, making	eels a very hot topic of study.
"019"	Giant snakeheads get their name	from the fact that their heads look	like those of snakes.	Their scales and patterns also look	like snakes', really bringing the	resemblance to a high degree.	They have sharp teeth, so don't	poke your finger anywhere near	their mouths!	Both males and females are well	known for protecting their eggs and	offspring.	They will scare off any other fish	that approach by frantically waving	their tails.
"020"	Bluegills have spikes on their dorsal	fins to help protect them from	enemies and harm.	Their offspring actually have a fairly	high survival rate when compared to	other fish.	The males chase away the females 	and take over protecting the eggs	and babies in the nest.	Although bluegills are small, they	are actually related quite closely	to black bass.
"021"	These fish are relatives of sea bass,	though they're preyed on by other,	larger fish, such as black bass.	Their defining features are their	large, prickly dorsal fins and gray	stripes on pale-yellow bodies.	Ice fishing on frozen lakes is a very	popular way to catch them in their	native United States and Canada.	They are often fried before being	eaten, which makes them a simple	but tasty meal.
"022"	They get their name from their	somewhat blackish bodies, though	they have a green tint.	They usually hide in weeds and wait	until other fish approach before	forcefully striking.	Many people use lures to catch	black bass because they are such	strong fish.	Black bass have a fierce image,	as the males will scare off other	fish to protect the fry in the nest.	They are related to sea bass, so	they make for a tasty dinner, though	their skin has a very strong odor.
"023"	Pike are only found in cold water,	so they cannot live in warmer parts	of the world.	They can grow over three feet long	and as such are a very popular fish	with anglers.	Pike have a slightly protruding jaw	and large mouths with sharp teeth,	making them powerful predators.	They use these teeth for tearing	apart not only other fish but also	birds and other aquatic creatures.
"024"	Pond smelt are small but vigorous	fish that can survive in water of	relatively poor quality.	Pond smelt are related to salmon	and as such have a lot of the same	migratory tendencies.	Most of them swim from rivers to	the ocean and then return to rivers	and lakes.	However, some of them actually live	in lakes that have no connection to	the ocean, so they don't migrate.	They have small fins and are perfect	for eating whole as tempura or	grilled on barbecues.
"025"	Sweetfish are migratory fish born	upstream that travel to the ocean	and then return to rivers to spawn.	This migratory mind-set is what	emphasizes their similarity to	salmon.	Adult sweetfish have a watermelon-	like mossy smell when caught, since	they eat moss on riverbed rocks.	Sweetfish are very territorial and	will attack rivals that encroach on	their territory.	Anglers use this combative nature	against them by using lures made	of other sweetfish.
"026"	The spotted pattern on cherry	salmon serves as camouflage and	is rather common in all salmon.	Most cherry salmon spend their 	lives in rivers, but some do migrate	to the ocean to fully mature.	They are popular with anglers	because of their well-balanced	physique and beautiful patterns.	Plus, their nervous nature makes	them a good challenge to catch,	which just adds to the fun.
"027"	Char are related to salmon and live	in rivers upstream, not generally	migrating to the ocean.	They prefer colder water and dwell	in secluded, clear rivers deep in	mountain ranges.	Since they tend to hide mostly in	between rocks in these cold areas,	they can be rather difficult to spot.
"028"	When rainbow trout get bigger,	they develop a pretty pink band	from their gills to their tails.	Some of them spend their entire	lives in rivers, while others live in	the ocean.	Steelhead trout are a unique type of	rainbow trout that live in the ocean	and return to freshwater to spawn.	Rainbow trout are a major species	of fish, but finding them in the wild	is actually fairly rare.
"029"	Stringfish live in cold rivers, can	grow to over a yard long, and are	stout and bulky like logs.	They live up to 20 years but grow	so slowly that it takes them 15	years to reach full maturity.	They are called "phantom fish"	because there are so few of them.	Adults are particularly hard to find.
"030"	Salmon are popular migratory fish	that are born in rivers, migrate to	oceans, and return in four years.	In Japan, flavored salmon eggs	are a very popular dish called ikura,	but it hasn't caught on in the US.	In rare cases, salmon will only stay	in the ocean for one or two years	before coming back.	These fish are known as "phantom	salmon" since they're so hard to	find in the wild.	Their characteristic pink color	comes from the shrimp and krill	they get in their diet.	If they ate differently, their flesh	would be white.
"031"	King salmon grow to about twice	the size of regular salmon, which	really helps them embody the name.	This size essentially makes them	the actual kings of salmon, though	they are also called chinook salmon.	In some regions, they return to the	river in spring or summer and live	there until spawning in the fall.	In rare cases, king salmons' meat	will be white, but these are not as	popular since pink is the standard.
"032"	Officially known as the mitten	crab, they also go by the name	"shanghai crab."	They are commonly used in Chinese	dishes, which is how most people	become familiar with them.	Their breeding habits are the	complete opposite of salmon in	that they hatch in the ocean first.	They then move up rivers when	they reach adult size, returning	to the ocean in order to spawn.
"033"	Guppies are tropical fish that are	related to killifish and live in warm	rivers.	They are popular fish that have	been bred to have beautiful flowing	tail fins.	Mother guppies give birth to their	babies after the eggs hatch in their	bellies.	They give birth at a rate that's	nearly constant, so their population	tends to grow rather quickly.
"034"	The official name given to this	warm-water-dwelling species of	fish is "Garra rufa."	They are omnivorous, as they both	eat algae and scrape the skin off	other fish.	All you'd have to do to feed them is	stick your hand in the tank; they	would live off your dead skin.	That's why they're called nibble	fish. They exfoliate but don't have	any teeth, so it doesn't hurt at all!
"035"	These tropical fish move very	gracefully because of long fins 	on their backs and underbellies.	Males and females are almost	impossible to tell apart, making	identification tricky.	They lay eggs among water plants.	Both genders look after the babies	while they cling to the weeds.	The young look like any other fish,	but they gain their angelfish looks	once they leave the weeds.
"036"	Neon tetras get their name from	the beautiful blue metallic line	on their bodies.	Although they're shy, gentle fish,	surprisingly they're related to	piranha, though very distantly.	They have very sharp and narrow	teeth, an odd contrast to their	beauty.	They are delicate fish who tend to	be very sensitive to the cleanliness	and temperature of water.
"037"	They have terrifyingly sharp teeth,	which contributes to their ferocious	reputation.	Oddly enough, they are actually	quite timid, though they are still	very dangerous fish.	If they can't find food, they will	resort to cannibalism or tear apart	any animal they can grab hold of.	Take care when catching them so	they don't end up biting your hand	with their sharp teeth!
"038"	Arowanas are ancient fish that	have remained basically unchanged	for 100 million years.	They are known for their large	scales and the hair that sticks out	from their lower lips.	They have a remarkable jumping	ability and can leap over a yard	above the surface of the water.	Males protect babies by keeping	them in their mouths and releasing	them once they reach a certain size.
"039"	Dorado means "golden" in Spanish.	As the name would indicate, these	fish are gold and have black dots.	They look like salmon but are very	toothy, carnivorous, and related	to piranha.	They're such ferocious fish that	other fish regularly flee from them,	fearful of becoming a snack.	Their ferocious natures and power	make them a prize catch among	anglers.
"040"	Their long faces and large mouths	make them look like alligators.	Some can grow up to three yards.	They are ancient fish that haven't	changed since they first appeared	millions of years ago.	They breathe not only through gills,	but also by sticking their mouths	above the surface of the water.	Gar eggs are poisonous, so people	all over the world are advised to	not eat them—no exceptions.
"041"	Arapaima, at over two yards long,	are one of the largest freshwater-	fish breeds in the world.	They've been around for over 100	million years, making them rather	ancient fish as well.	They breathe through gills but also	with an air bladder used by poking	their mouths above water.	They have hard, course tongues	that are used to break down the	smaller fish they eat.
"042"	The cool-looking saddled bichir are	ancient fish with spiky fins on	their backs.	Though they've been around for	more than 400 million years, they	remain relatively unchanged.	They have big appetites and will	wait to ambush any fish they think	will fit in their mouths.	They can grow up to 30 inches long,	making them rather large fish	indeed.	They swim slowly in a way that	gives them the appearance of	walking like dinosaurs.
"043"	Sea butterflies go with the flow, as	they'll drift in cold winter waters	along with ice floes.	They are called "ice-floe angels"	because of the mysterious way	they swim with their winglike arms.	Their heads will open up when they	make an attempt to catch their	helpless prey.	Once its head is opened, it grabs its	prey with six special feelers called	"buccal cones."	The only place you'll find both cold-	water and tropical sea butterflies	swimming together is in this game.
"044"	Sea horses don't look like fish,	but they still share a lot of	distinct connections.	They use their small dorsal fins and	tail fins to swim, but in actuality	they're pretty bad swimmers.	They wrap their tail fins around	seaweed or coral so they won't	float away with the current.	Once attached, they feed on	plankton and small shrimp that	float by.	The female deposits eggs in the	male's pouch, putting the burden	of child care on the male.
"045"	Clown fish spend their lives hiding	among the feelers of sea anemones,	a place that only they can live.	Their homes may be dangerous, but	they produce a special coating that	protects them from the poison.	In exchange for the anemone's	protection, the clown fish chases	off any parasitic bugs and enemies.	Curiously, all clown fish are males	when they're young but change	into females if necessity demands.
"046"	These tropical fish sport beautiful,	yellow, triangular tails and elegant	black lines on dazzling blue bodies.	Personalitywise, the surgeonfish	is actually rather laid back and	timid.	They seek out gaps in coral or	between rocks for the greatest	amount of protection while sleeping.
"047"	Butterfly fish are considered very	cute pets, popular because of their	beautiful nature.	They glide through the warm seas	by flapping their yellow bodies as if	they were butterflies.	Their diets are surprisingly hardy,	as they gobble coral and poisonous	anemones using narrow mouths.	Butterfly-fish couples have been	known to live together for 10 years	or more.	Often they can be seen swimming	around in pairs. You'll likely never	find a better underwater romance.
"048"	Called Napoleonfish, these fish	also have the more accurate name	of humphead wrasse.	The true name comes from the	distinctive humps on their heads.	But "Napoleonfish" is more popular.	When small, all Napoleonfish are	females, but some become males as	they age and their humps grow.	Their bodies also turn a bluer shade	as they mature and become males,	making identification simple.	Their bulky bodies, which can get to	about six feet long, still glide easily	through warm tropical seas.	Finding these fish is a real treat for	divers, as they're stunning to see—	and it's a great story to tell.
"049"	Zebra turkeyfish have long,	beautiful fins that flow like gowns	as they swim through the sea.	However, these aquatic beauties	pack a punch, as their fins are filled	with poisonous spikes.	Aside from protection against	predators, this poison comes in	handy for turf wars between males.	The losing male succumbs to the	poison in a matter of days, making	these battles life and death.
"050"	Blowfish are considered a delicacy,	famous for their tempting taste	despite being highly poisonous.	Blowfish are not poisonous at birth,	though, which makes young ones	relatively safe for consumption.	It's only once they have ingested	enough microbes from seawater and	food that they become poisonous.	When they feel threatened, they	suck in air and water to blow	themselves up like balloons.	This makes them too big to eat	without predators being forced to	chomp down on their poison quills.
"051"	As expected, all puffer fish are	covered in spines. While related to	blowfish, they are not poisonous.	Exaggerated claims about the fish	say they have 1,000 spines; the true	number is between 300 and 400.	When threatened, they suck in water	and air to puff themselves up in	order to intimidate enemies.
"052"	With their appealing flavor, horse	mackerel have long been a cheap	and common food source.	However, in certain regions, they	have actually been branded as	something of a luxury dish.	They have tough scales on both	sides of their bodies that must	be removed before preparing.	Though small, they are formidable	carnivores. Since they go after bait,	they are popular with fishers.
"053"	Barred knifejaws stand out thanks	to the seven stripes adorning their	white bodies.	Their natural curiosity and strong	pull make them a popular target of	anglers, but they're no easy catch.	They have strong teeth that allow	them to make short work of sea	creatures with tough shells.	This means that both urchins and	mollusks need to be careful, lest	they become meals for these fish.
"054"	Sea bass are famous for their	delicious white meat as well as	their large size.	If they ingest something inedible,	they open up their mouths and gills	and violently shake their heads.	This generally manages to expel the	foreign material, though it has the	added effect of looking rather odd.	Much like their freshwater cousins,	sea bass have a strong pull, making	them a great challenge for anglers.
"055"	Red snappers are gregarious fish	that often form schools close to	reefs and shipwrecks.	They are a prized food fish, but	because of demand, other species	are often served as "red snapper."	They usually live up to 50 years.	The oldest recorded red snapper	was thought to be 57.
"056"	Dabs generally have both eyes on	the right side of their body, though	there are some exceptions.	Both types of dabs begin in infancy	with an eye on each side of their	body.	As dabs grow, the eye on the left	migrates to the right, though	sometimes it doesn't move at all.	Dabs dig in the sand to hide, which	allows their eyes to stick up a bit	to watch for danger.	Because they live off of bugs and	small creatures, their mouths are	small, containing narrow, dull teeth.
"057"	Olive flounders are rather flexible	whitefish that have both eyes on	the left side of their body.	They can reach three feet in length	and are commonly mistaken for	dabs, a close relative.	When young, they have an eye on	each side, but as they age, their	right eye migrates to their left side.	These carnivorous fish can change	color to camouflage themselves on	the seabed as they wait for prey.
"058"	People assume squids have legs, but	those are actually arms. There are	10 in all; two are used to grab prey.	To swim, they twist their fins and	expel water from inside their bodies	to allow for fluid motion.	The ink they shoot when threatened	forms into the shape of a squid,	acting as a sort of body double.
"059"	Moray eels can often be seen	sticking just their heads out	from between two rocks.	When unsuspecting prey approaches,	they dart out to snatch it up into	their sharp-toothed mouths.	Once moray eels have their teeth in	you, it's hard to get away, making	moray-eel bites no trifling matter.	Their long, finless bodies are	covered in tough, snakelike skin	that often gets used as leather.
"060"	Ribbon eels have long, ribbonlike	bodies and look as if they have	flowers sprouting from their noses.	They get their name from their	bright, vivid color, in addition to	the length of their skinny bodies.	Ribbon eels hatch sexless before	first becoming males, then females	as they age.	Their tendency to stick their heads	out from holes in the sand and open	their mouths is not a sign of anger.	In actuality, they're merely taking a	breath. Oddly, they're surprisingly	peaceful creatures, despite the look.
"061"	Football fish live in parts of the	ocean so deep that light does not	reach them.	Their lanterns, which they sway	back and forth to lure prey, can	emit light thanks to special bacteria.	When prey gets near, they shoot a	luminescent liquid and snatch the	prey while it's blinded by the light.	Only females possess the useful	lantern. They can grow to be about	two feet by maturity.	Males are small, less than two	inches in length.
"062"	Tuna can reach almost 10 feet in	length and weigh over 800 pounds,	which is huge in the fish world.	Combining this great size with their	good flavor makes them literally the	biggest catch for most anglers.	Tuna can't breathe when they aren't	moving, so their entire lives revolve	around constantly swimming.	To sleep, they merely slow down.	This ability to swim while sleeping	is a huge advantage.	They're also rather fast, capable of	beating both sets of fins so hard	they reach speeds of 50 mph.
"063"	Blue marlins are famous for their	long, swordlike noses that give	them the nickname "swordfish."	They use their "swords" to knock	out their prey before capture, not	skewering it as you'd think.	Able to swim at speeds above 60	mph, their speed and power make	them a true test for any angler.
"064"	Though you wouldn't guess it	because of their size, giant trevallys	are actually a type of mackerel.	Unlike normally slim and sleek	mackerels, giant trevallys have	wide, silver bodies.	Surprisingly, though, these fish	cannot tolerate the cold, so they	tend to live in warmer places.	Their jaw strength is great enough	to bite off a person's finger, so be	very careful when fishing for them!
"065"	Beating their large fins up and down	to move through the water almost	gives rays the impression of flying.	If viewed from below, rays appear	to have their mouths curled up into	a sort of smile.	Some varieties have poisonous	spikes at the base of their long tail	fins that can be fatal to humans.	This, combined with the ability to	hide in sand at the bottom of the	sea, can make them very dangerous.
"066"	Ocean sunfish are a relative of	blowfish that can reach up to	two tons in weight.	Lacking a tail fin, they cannot swim	particularly quickly, which is an odd	bit of anatomical detriment.	The number of eggs they can lay	is the most in the world at over	300 million.	However, out of that 300 million,	only one or two fish will ultimately	survive.	Ocean sunfish sometimes like to	bob up and down on the surface	of the ocean.	This gives them the appearance	they're sunbathing, which helps to	make them a popular breed of fish.
"067"	The hammerhead shark is a shark	with a head like a hammer, which	is what you'd expect.	However, despite being sharks,	they are actually fairly laid back,	which is not what you'd expect.	With their eyes positioned on the	two ends of their "hammer," they	can see in almost all directions.	Oddly, their nose holes are located	right next to their eyes on their	hammer section.	They have a number of small holes	on the front and lower portions	of their heads as well.	These holes allow them to detect	prey, even fish hiding below them	and out of sight.	While they eat a nice array of fish,	it seems rays are their favorite	source of food. Rays, beware!
"068"	The triangular teeth of sharks	appear to have evolved from scales	sometime in the past.	When a tooth breaks, it quickly falls	out and a new one grows in, keeping	them always in good shape for prey.	Sharks can be fearsome creatures,	able to smell blood from several	miles away.	They can even jump out of the	water to catch prey, making them	powerful predators.	Contrary to their tough image, their	bones are made out of cartilage and	erroneously used as health food.
"069"	Saw sharks got their name from	their long head lined with spikelike	teeth much like a chain-saw blade.	Sensors located below their mouths	detect prey as they press their flat	bodies against the seabed to search.	They will sometimes swing their	"saws" wildly amid a school of fish,	catching any that are struck.
"070"	Whale sharks are the world's	largest fish, but they're surprisingly	some of the gentlest.	They can swim at only three mph,	so although they're large and very	imposing, they're not really a threat.	They swim with their mouths open	to swallow vast quantities of tiny	creatures and seawater.	As they expel the water through	their gills, they will eat what then	remains.	Since they don't have to bite prey,	their teeth are file-like and number	about 10,000 in multiple rows.
"071"	Oarfish are deep-sea-dwelling fish	with long, thin, silver bodies and one	red fin lining their backs.	They can reach lengths of over	10 yards, making them huge and	striking fish.	They usually swim by twisting their	long, thin bodies, but they can also	swim in more vertical positions.	Their mouths are small compared to	their bodies and they have no teeth,	so they're large but not imposing.
"072"	Coelacanths are ancient fish once	believed to be extinct but recently	discovered around South Africa.	Called "living fossils," they have	apparently changed very little over	the past 400 million years.	They can live for over 60 years and	reach lengths of six feet but have	rather small brains, even for fish.	They have more fins and harder	scales than the average fish, making	them a rather resilient breed.	Their flavor is very different from	most fish, and they contain a fat	that is indigestible by humans.	It's for that second reason that	eating them really isn't highly	recommended.

"001"	Estos peces son tan pequeños	que a uno le caben en la palma	de la mano.	Durante la época de apareamiento,	el vientre del macho se vuelve de	color rosa para atraer a la hembra.	Viven en ríos o lagos y depositan	sus huevos en grandes bivalvos,	donde eclosionan y viven un tiempo.
"002"	Se diferencian de sus parientes las	carpas por tener aletas caudales	más largas y grandes bocas.	Son grandes saltadores, lo que les	permite alimentarse de insectos	que pululan sobre el agua.	Se les considera muy activos y de	mal carácter, por lo que son unos	auténticos supervivientes.	Durante la época de apareamiento,	el vientre del macho se vuelve rosa	y el lomo azul.
"003"	Los carpines son fáciles de atrapar	para los pescadores novatos, pero	también gustan a los veteranos.	Están emparentados con los koi y	pueden llegar a los veinte años, por	lo que son perfectos para acuarios.	Machos nacen muy pocos, por lo	que las hembras son dominantes	y esto repercute en las poblaciones.	Por suerte, las hembras son	compatibles con machos de otras	especies para mitigar el problema.
"004"	Los leuciscos viven en aguas más	turbias de lo normal, pero al haber	muchos son fáciles de detectar.	Son parientes de las carpas, aunque	a diferencia de ellas pueden vivir	tanto en agua salada como dulce.	Una franja de color naranja sale	en el vientre de los machos cuando	están listos para el apareamiento.
"005"	Hay más distancia entre	los ojos y la boca en los	barbos que en las carpas.	Casi parece que miran con la	cabeza gacha, como si estuvieran	avergonzados de algo.	Otra diferencia es la longitud de	los bigotes, algo mayor en el caso	de las carpas.	Los barbos tienen muchas espinas,	pero son totalmente comestibles y	tienen un sabor similar a la platija.
"006"	La longevidad de estos peces	es extraordinaria y pueden	vivir hasta cien años.	Las carpas son fáciles de distinguir	por sus bigotes, una de sus señas	de identidad.	Son omnívoras y se alimentan de	insectos y plantas acuáticas que	succionan con la boca.	También tienen unas bacterias en la	garganta que las ayudan a abrir el	marisco para después digerirlo.
"007"	Aunque suelen ser de colores	apagados, estos peces de acuario	pueden tener dibujos muy bonitos.	La cría selectiva de especímenes	con mutaciones genéticas ha dado	lugar a una variedad impresionante.	No hay dos peces koi con los	mismos dibujos, de ahí que sean	conocidos como "joyas vivientes".	Algunos alcanzan un gran valor	en el mercado según sus dibujos	y colores.	Como pueden vivir hasta cien años	con los cuidados necesarios, son	perfectos para poblar estanques.
"008"	Estos peces de acuario proceden	de la cría selectiva de distintas	variedades de carpín.	Llevó siglos conseguir el color y	la larga aleta caudal que esta	especie exhibe en la actualidad.	Los peces dorados son de color	negro en la juventud y presentan	otros vestigios del carpín.	A medida que crecen se vuelven	de color rojo, sin duda mucho	más característico.
"009"	Los ojos saltones que dan nombre	a este pez y por los que es conocido	son un verdadero inconveniente.	Su visión es tan mala que a menudo	pasa de largo de la comida y se	va chocando por todas partes.	Es una especie de pez dorado y	desarrolla los ojos más o menos	a los dos meses de vida.
"010"	Los killi son unos peces de agua	dulce bastante pequeños que se	juntan en bancos para desplazarse.	Se les encuentra en zonas poco	profundas y se alimentan de los	insectos que hay en la superficie.	Por esa razón tienen la boca a la	altura de los ojos, característica	que los hace buenos cazadores.	Como están a la misma temperatura	que el agua que los rodea, pueden	asustarse al mínimo cambio.
"011"	Estos bogavantes en miniatura	viven en sitios tan comunes	como arroyos y estanques.	Esto se debe a que son muy	numerosos y capaces de comer	prácticamente cualquier cosa.	Curiosamente, el caparazón	cambia de color según sus	hábitos alimenticios.	El azul indica que se alimentan de	peces y el rojo que prefieren las	plantas, mucho más adecuadas.
"012"	Estas parientes de las tortugas	comunes son obstinadas y no	sueltan una vez que han mordido.	Sin embargo, esto no quiere decir	que sean temerarias, sino más bien	todo lo contrario.	Suelen estar en el agua, en parte	porque su caparazón plano las	hace grandes nadadoras.	Siempre que nadan mantienen	el morro en la superficie	para poder respirar.	Es mejor no intentar cogerlas	porque suelen morder a la	primera de cambio.	En el caso de que eso suceda,	hay que ponerlas de nuevo en el	agua para que sigan su camino.
"013"	Los renacuajos son básicamente	las larvas de las ranas y suelen	estar en charcos y arroyos.	Tienen un aspecto muy particular	que los distingue claramente de	las ranas en estado adulto.	Al principio son solo cabeza y cola,	pero con el tiempo desarrollan las	patas y van perdiendo la cola.	Hay que tratarlos con cuidado	porque, al no tener escamas,	resultan muy delicados.
"014"	Las ranas muestran preferencia	por los estanques, los pantanos y	en general los sitios con humedad.	Son terrestres, así que presentan	piel y pulmones en vez de branquias	a los lados del cuello.	Los renacuajos sí tienen branquias,	pero las pierden cuando llegan a la	fase adulta.	Casi siempre están húmedas,	porque de lo contrario tendrían	problemas para respirar.	Algunas especies tienen la piel	venenosa, por lo que ante la duda	lo mejor es no tocarlas.
"015"	Estos peces de agua dulce cortos	y achaparrados desgarran a sus	presas con sus afilados dientes.	Los gobios excavan debajo de las	rocas para dejar sus huevos, y los	machos se encargan de vigilarlos.	Algunos son un poco vagos y dejan	sus huevos en un nido ajeno para	no tener que ocuparse de ellos.
"016"	Las lochas son peces de pequeño	tamaño que viven en ríos y aguas	fangosas.	Tienen diez bigotes alrededor de la	boca con papilas que les permiten	distinguir entre dulce y amargo.	Las lochas se distinguen por	respirar tanto a través de las	branquias como de los intestinos.	Inhalan al sacar la boca fuera	del agua y exhalan por la parte	cercana a la cola.	Hay quien dice que un buen guiso	de locha con huevo es perfecto	para recuperar energías.
"017"	Los siluros o peces gato son	famosos por tener largos bigotes	y bocas muy grandes.	También tienen ojos grandes	pero no buena vista, por lo que	son de hábitos nocturnos.	Algunos de ellos presentan unas	líneas verticales en las que se	advierte una serie de orificios.	Estos orificios les sirven para	detectar las corrientes eléctricas	que generan otros peces y cazarlos.	Aunque no lo parezcan por su	comportamiento habitual, son	carnívoros y muy voraces.
"018"	Las anguilas nacen en el mar y	nadan corriente arriba por los	ríos cuando se hacen adultas.	Curiosamente, emprenden la vuelta	al mar cuando da comienzo la	época de desove.	Tienen veneno en la sangre,	de ahí que no se puedan comer	crudas en formato sashimi.	No obstante, se pueden consumir	sin problemas una vez cocinadas	y son un plato muy popular.	Los lugares escogidos por las	anguilas para dejar sus huevos	eran un misterio hasta hace poco.	Cada vez se sabe más sobre sus	costumbres debido a que son un	tema recurrente de investigación.
"019"	Como se puede intuir, estos peces	se llaman así por tener una cabeza	parecida a la de una serpiente.	El parecido no acaba ahí, puesto	que sus escamas también recuerdan	mucho a la de dichos reptiles.	Cuentan con dientes muy afilados,	así que lo más seguro es no	ponerles ni un dedo encima.	Tanto el macho como la hembra	son conocidos por defender sus	huevos y alevines con ferocidad.	No dudarán en agitar sus colas	como locos para ahuyentar a todo	el que se acerque a ellos.
"020"	Estos peces cuentan con púas en	las aletas dorsales para protegerse	de depredadores y otras amenazas.	La tasa de supervivencia de sus	alevines está muy por encima	de la de otras especies.	Esto se debe a que los machos	los protegen junto a los huevos	cuando están en el nido.	También cuenta que suelen elegir	lugares con muchas plantas entre	las que esconderse.
"021"	Esta perca se distingue de otras	por el color amarillo claro que	se aprecia en sus escamas.	También tienen rayas grises	y un par de aletas dorsales	provistas de púas.	Se suelen pescar en los lagos	helados que hay en Canadá	y Estados Unidos.	La perca amarilla frita no es un	plato sofisticado, pero sí muy	popular y sabroso.
"022"	El color verde que cubre las	escamas de las percas suele	confundirse con negro.	Se esconden entre las plantas	y permanecen a la espera de las	presas para atacar con rapidez.	Son peces bastante difíciles de	pescar, por lo que normalmente	se deben emplear señuelos.	Los machos harán lo que sea	necesario con tal de ahuyentar a	las amenazas y proteger a sus crías.	Se trata de una especie muy	adaptable que se encuentra en	ríos, estanques y hasta pantanos.	Son perfectamente comestibles	y de hecho son muy sabrosas si	uno es capaz de aguantar el olor.
"023"	Los lucios son peces de agua	dulce que solo se encuentran	en lugares fríos.	Algunos superan el metro y medio	de longitud y son muy codiciados	en la pesca con caña.	Tienen una boca grande y dientes	muy afilados que los hacen unos	depredadores de categoría.	En su dieta hay sitio para peces,	aves y otros animales acuáticos,	así que mucho cuidadito.
"024"	Los eperlanos son peces pequeños	y vigorosos capaces de sobrevivir	en aguas de baja calidad.	Eso sí, hay que tener en cuenta que	solo viven uno o dos años incluso	en las mejores condiciones.	Están emparentados con el salmón,	pez con el que comparten sus	hábitos migratorios.	Casi todos nadan del río al mar	y al revés cuando toca emprender	el camino de vuelta.	Los que viven en lagos no tienen	ese problema y están siempre	en el mismo sitio.	La pesca del eperlano en lagos	helados es un pasatiempo muy	extendido en todo el mundo.	Debido a su tamaño, son perfectos	para prepararlos rebozados o a la	parrilla.
"025"	El ayu es un pez migratorio que	nace río arriba, viaja al mar y	vuelve al río para desovar.	No es de extrañar que esté	emparentado con el salmón,	muy conocido por este hábito.	Estos peces se alimentan del musgo	que crece en las rocas, lo que les da	un olor muy característico.	Son muy territoriales y no dudan	en atacar a otros de su misma	especie a la mínima invasión.	Los pescadores se aprovechan	de su naturaleza combativa al usar	señuelos muy parecidos a los ayus.
"026"	Las motas que cubren al salmón	japonés le sirven para camuflarse	y se ven también en otros salmones.	La mayoría de ellos permanece	toda la vida en el río, pero algunos	deciden migrar al mar.	Los ejemplares normales alcanzan	el medio metro de longitud y los	dos kilos y medio de peso.	Sus bonitas escamas y su buen	equilibrio corporal los hacen muy	atractivos para la pesca con caña.	Además, el hecho de que tengan	un carácter esquivo hace que sea	mucho más desafiante.
"027"	Las truchas son peces de río	emparentados con los salmones,	pero no son migratorias.	Prefieren las aguas bien frías,	por eso se encuentran sobre todo	en zonas montañosas.	Suelen esconderse entre las rocas,	por lo que a menudo resultan muy	difíciles de detectar.
"028"	Cuando las truchas arcoíris crecen,	desarrollan una bonita franja rosa	desde las branquias hasta la cola.	Se adaptan tan bien al entorno	que pueden vivir tanto en los	ríos como en el mar.	Algunas son migratorias y	cambian el mar por el río	en la época de desove.	Por desgracia, el que antaño era	un pez muy común tiene ahora	una presencia muy reducida.
"029"	Los taimenes viven en aguas frías,	pueden alcanzar los dos metros y	pesar más de veinte kilos.	Viven hasta veinte años, pero se	desarrollan despacio y necesitan	quince para llegar a la madurez.	En general son muy difíciles de	encontrar, pero todavía más si	están en la fase adulta.
"030"	Los salmones son sin ninguna	duda los peces migratorios por	antonomasia.	Nacen en los ríos, se desplazan	hasta el mar y vuelven corriente	arriba al cabo de cuatro años.	Aunque no es lo normal, algunos	salmones se van durante solo dos	años en lugar de cuatro.	Precisamente estos tienen un	sabor muy característico y	apreciado.	El color rosado del salmón es	la consecuencia de una dieta	rica en gambas y similares.	Si comieran otra cosa serían	de color blanco como muchos	otros pescados.
"031"	Un salmón real puede alcanzar el	doble de tamaño que un salmón	normal, de ahí su nombre.	Es la especie de salmón más grande	que existe y también es conocida	como "salmón chinuc".	En algunos lugares vuelven al río en	primavera y verano, aunque algunos	prefieren esperar hasta otoño.	A veces tienen la carne blanca	y no rosada, como suele ser	normal en los salmones.
"032"	A pesar de su nombre, esta especie	no se encuentra solo en Asia, sino	también en Europa y América.	Su sabor es bien conocido en todo	el mundo debido a su presencia en	muchos platos de origen chino.	Su ciclo de vida es completamente	opuesto al de los salmones y de	hecho nacen en el mar.	Cuando se hacen adultos pueblan	los ríos y regresan al mar en la	época de desove.	Su rasgo más distintivo es el pelo	que recubre sus pinzas como si	estuvieran provistas de guantes.
"033"	Los gupis son unos peces tropicales	emparentados con los killi que viven	en ríos de aguas cálidas.	Se les ha criado para que tengan	colas muy vistosas y así den color 	a los acuarios de medio mundo.	Las madres llevan los huevos en su	interior hasta que eclosionan, por	lo que son animales ovovivíparos.	Se reproducen varias veces al año,	por lo que no tienen problemas 	para mantener la población.
"034"	El nombre científico de estos peces	que viven en aguas dulces y cálidas	es "Garra rufa".	Son omnívoros y se alimentan	tanto de algas como de la piel	muerta de otros peces.	Basta con meter la mano en una	pecera para que estos pececillos	se encarguen de exfoliarla.	Como no tienen dientes, este 	proceso llamado "ictioterapia"	no resulta en absoluto doloroso.
"035"	Este precioso pez tropical utiliza	sus grandes aletas para moverse	por el agua con gracilidad.	El macho y la hembra se parecen	tanto que resultan muy difíciles	de distinguir a simple vista.	Ponen los huevos en plantas	acuáticas y los dos padres se	reparten la tarea de vigilarlos.	Los alevines pueden pasar por	cualquier otro pez hasta que	desarrollan las aletas.
"036"	Estos peces reciben su nombre	de la bonita línea azul brillante	que lucen en las escamas.	Aunque nadie lo diría por su	docilidad, son parientes de	las tan temidas pirañas.	Hay que fijarse en sus dientes	finos y afilados para encontrar	algún parecido.	Son muy sensibles a los cambios	de temperatura y limpieza del agua	en la que viven.
"037"	La reputación de animales	feroces les viene de lo afilados	que tienen los dientes.	En realidad son bastante tímidas, 	pero eso no quita que también 	sean muy peligrosas.	No dudan en devorarse unas a	otras ante la imposibilidad de	encontrar alimento.	Pese a lo que comúnmente se cree	no son exclusivamente carnívoras,	sino omnívoras.
"038"	Los arowanas son peces muy	antiguos que llevan sin evolucionar	unos cien millones de años.	Se les conoce por tener unas	escamas muy grandes y un único	bigote en el labio inferior.	Son muy ágiles y pueden saltar	alrededor de un metro y medio	por encima de la superficie.	Los machos guardan a las crías	en la boca y las dejan salir cuando	tienen el tamaño suficiente.
"039"	Por supuesto, estos peces son de	color dorado y además tienen unas	motas negras muy vistosas.	Parecen salmones, pero están	emparentados con la piraña, tienen	dientes afilados y son carnívoros.	Los demás peces suelen huir	despavoridos al verlos por el	temor a ser devorados.	Son tan fuertes y feroces que	se consideran todo un trofeo	en la pesca con caña.
"040"	Con esas cabezas tan largas y todos	esos dientes parecen caimanes, y de	hecho prácticamente lo son.	Estos peces llevan millones de años	sin evolucionar y pueden superar los	dos metros y medio de longitud.	Respiran por las branquias, pero	también sacan el morro fuera de	la superficie con el mismo fin.	Los huevos que ponen son	venenosos, así que lo mejor	es no intentar comerlos.
"041"	Con una longitud que puede superar	los tres metros, son de los peces de	agua dulce más grandes que existen.	Llevan entre nosotros unos cien	millones de años, por lo que son	una especie muy antigua.	Respiran mediante branquias y una	vejiga natatoria, para lo cual tienen	que sacar la boca fuera del agua.	Están provistos de lenguas muy	fuertes y con hueso que les ayudan	a devorar peces más pequeños.
"042"	Estos peces tan curiosos son muy	antiguos y cuentan con aletas	puntiagudas en el lomo.	Apenas han cambiado en los	cuatrocientos millones de años	que llevan en el planeta.	Tienen un apetito voraz y se	lanzarán a por cualquier pez	que les quepa en la boca.	Pueden alcanzar los ochenta	centímetros, por lo que además	de antiguos son bastante grandes.	Más que nadar andan sobre sus	aletas, cosa que en cierto modo	recuerda a los dinosaurios.
"043"	Las mariposas marinas se dejan	llevar por la corriente en las	aguas invernales.	Se las puede ver moviendo los	brazos como si fueran alas y	rodeadas de témpanos de hielo.	Cuando quieren atrapar a una	presa primero tienen que	abrir la cabeza.	En su interior tienen seis tentáculos	que se denominan "aparato bucal",	como en los insectos.	El único lugar en el que coexisten	mariposas marinas tropicales y de	aguas frías es este juego.
"044"	Los caballitos de mar o hipocampos	no parecen peces, pero en realidad	sí lo son.	Emplean sus aletas dorsales para	moverse, pero a decir verdad no	son muy buenos nadadores.	Por norma general, se agarran a las	plantas acuáticas con las aletas	de la cola para no ser arrastrados.	Una vez en esta posición se	alimentan de plancton y pequeños	crustáceos que pasen por allí.	La hembra pone los huevos en la	bolsa del macho, que es de donde	nacen las crías.
"045"	Los peces payaso viven entre los	tentáculos de las anémonas, sitio	vedado a otras especies.	En teoría es muy peligroso, pero	desarrollan una capa especial que	los hace inmunes al veneno.	A cambio de protección, los peces	payaso libran a la anémona de	los parásitos que pueda tener.	Un dato curioso es que estos peces	nacen siempre machos y pasan a ser	hembras según la necesidad.
"046"	Azules, con rayas negras y con colas	amarillas de forma triangular, estos	peces tropicales son pura elegancia.	No son temperamentales, sino más	bien tranquilos, solitarios y poco	dados a meterse en conflictos.	Para protegerse mientras duermen	suelen esconderse entre las rocas y	los corales.	Ante las amenazas su estrategia	consiste en colocarse de lado y	hacerse el muerto.
"047"	Los peces mariposa son tan bonitos	que no son difíciles de encontrar en	acuarios domésticos.	Se desplazan por las aguas de los	mares cálidos agitando sus cuerpos	como si fueran alas de mariposa.	A pesar de tener bocas estrechas,	se alimentan de cosas como coral	y hasta de anémonas venenosas.	Una vez emparejados, los peces	mariposa pueden estar juntos la	friolera de diez años.	Casi siempre van unidos, lo que	los convierte en una de las especies	más románticas que existen.
"048"	Aunque "peces napoleón" es su 	nombre más común, también son	conocidos como "maoríes".	Su rasgo más distintivo es	el bulto que exhiben justo	encima de la cabeza.	Todos nacen hembras, pero	algunos se convierten en machos	cuando alcanzan cierta edad.	Los machos son más grandes y	de un azul más intenso, así que	son fáciles de identificar.	Nadan con gracilidad, y eso que	pueden superar los dos metros de	longitud y los 200 kilos de peso.	Son todo un espectáculo, por	eso encontrarlos es el objetivo	de muchos buceadores.
"049"	Las aletas del pez león lo convierten	en uno de los peces más vistosos	que surcan los mares.	No obstante, al lado de ellas	tienen unas púas cargadas	con un veneno muy potente.	Además de para defenderse,	las usan para luchar y decidir	quién es el macho dominante.	El perdedor muere al cabo de unos	días por el veneno, así que son	peleas a vida o muerte.
"050"	El pez globo está considerado una	exquisitez pese a contar con un	veneno extremadamente potente.	No obstante, cuando nacen no son	venenosos, así que se pueden comer	más o menos con seguridad.	Adquieren esta propiedad tras	ingerir una gran cantidad de	microbios del agua y la comida.	Cuando se sienten amenazados,	se llenan de aire y agua hasta	que se hinchan como un globo.	De esta manera son demasiado	grandes como para comérselos	sin morder las púas venenosas.
"051"	Como se puede imaginar, el pez	erizo está cubierto de púas, pero	no es venenoso como el pez globo.	Hay quien dice que tienen más de	mil púas, pero en realidad tienen	entre 300 y 400.	Su mecanismo de defensa consiste	en inflarse de agua y aire para	intimidar a sus enemigos.
"052"	El buen sabor del jurel lo ha	convertido en uno de los peces	más populares.	Aunque suelen ser baratos, hay	lugares en los que se consideran	un auténtico manjar.	Están provistos de escamas muy	resistentes a ambos lados que hay	que retirar antes de cocinar.	Son pequeños, pero cazan con	ferocidad. Su instinto depredador	hace que sean presas fáciles.
"053"	La dorada japonesa se hace notar	gracias a las siete rayas negras que	adornan su cuerpo blanco.	Se trata de un pez muy buscado en	la pesca con caña, pero es fuerte y	nada sencillo de atrapar.	Tiene unos dientes que le permiten	alimentarse hasta de los animales	con los caparazones más duros.	Los erizos de mar y los moluscos	se tienen que andar con ojo si no	quieren acabar en sus fauces.
"054"	La lubina es uno de los peces más	apreciados por el excelente sabor	de su carne blanca.	Cuando muerden algo que no es	comestible, abren la boca y las	branquias y agitan la cabeza.	Así se deshacen de elementos	extraños, aunque el efecto sea	un tanto peculiar.	Al ser peces muy vigorosos,	son un trofeo muy valioso en	la pesca con caña.
"055"	De escamas rojizas y excelente	sabor, el pargo rojo es uno de	los peces más apreciados.	Cuando hay escasez de la	especie, se suelen sustituir	por otros en los mercados.	Son peces muy resistentes	y longevos que pueden vivir	fácilmente cincuenta años.
"056"	Los gallos suelen tener los dos ojos	en el mismo lado del cuerpo, aunque	hay algunas excepciones.	En todo caso, al nacer los tienen	dispuestos a ambos lados como	cualquier otro pez.	A medida que crecen, el ojo	izquierdo se desplaza hasta	llegar al lado derecho.	Se entierran en la arena con los	ojos por fuera para escapar de	las amenazas y vigilar el entorno.	Tienen la boca estrecha y dientes	algo torpes, por lo que se alimentan	de presas muy pequeñas.
"057"	El rodaballo es un pez blanco muy	flexible con los dos ojos situados	en el lado izquierdo del cuerpo.	Puede alcanzar el metro de longitud	y se parece un poco al gallo, de ahí	que en ocasiones se confundan.	Al igual que este, nace con un ojo	a cada lado y el del derecho se pasa	al izquierdo a medida que crece.	Como es muy plano, se suele	colocar encima de la arena para	camuflarse ante los depredadores.
"058"	Se dice que los calamares tienen	patas, pero en realidad son brazos	con los que agarran a sus presas.	Además de las aletas, para nadar	mejor expulsan agua en lo que se	denomina "propulsión a chorro".	La tinta que liberan cuando se	sienten amenazados toma la forma	del calamar como si fuera un doble.
"059"	Es habitual encontrarse a las	morenas sacando la cabeza	entre dos rocas.	Cuando detectan una presa, salen	a toda velocidad para agarrarla	con sus fuertes mandíbulas.	Las morenas no sueltan una vez	han mordido, así que hay que ir	con mucho ojo si están cerca.	Por si esto fuera poco, algunas	especies están recubiertas de	una sustancia tóxica.
"060"	La cabeza de estas anguilas es	tan particular que parece que les	crezcan flores en el morro.	Son de un bonito color azul	eléctrico, además de largas	y extremadamente finas.	Nacen sin sexo, después pasan a ser	machos y finalmente son hembras	cuando alcanzan la madurez.	Se esconden en la arena y de vez	en cuando se asoman con la boca	abierta y un gesto agresivo.	Sin embargo, son animales muy	pacíficos y si hacen eso es porque	necesitan respirar.
"061"	El pez balón vive en el fondo del	mar rodeado de la más absoluta	oscuridad.	En la cabeza tiene una linterna que	mueve hacia delante y hacia atrás	cual caña para atraer a sus presas.	Cuando se acercan, el pez balón	dispara un líquido luminiscente que	las ciega y las deja vulnerables.	Las hembras alcanzan los sesenta	centímetros y son las únicas que	están provistas de linterna.	Los machos, en cambio, apenas	miden unos pocos centímetros	y no son tan buenos cazadores.
"062"	Los atunes pueden llegar a medir	tres metros y pesar 350 kilos,	algo impresionante para un pez.	Si además tenemos en cuenta su	buen sabor, no es de extrañar que	sea de los más buscados.	No pueden respirar a menos que	estén en movimiento, por eso tienen	que ir siempre de un lado para otro.	Para dormir les basta con bajar la	velocidad, una habilidad tan curiosa	como útil para la supervivencia.	Por si fuera poco, son capaces de	batir las aletas con mucha fuerza	hasta alcanzar los 80 km/h.
"063"	Se suele decir que los peces	espada atraviesan a sus presas	con el morro, pero no es cierto.	Más bien lo utilizan para darles	golpes y así conseguir que sean	más fáciles de cazar.	Son capaces de nadar a 100 km/h,	todo un reto para los pescadores	más experimentados.
"064"	El jurel gigante es un pez grande	que puede poner en apuros hasta	al pescador más avezado.	Recubierto de escamas plateadas,	el ejemplar más grande hallado pesa	ochenta kilos y mide 1,70 metros.	Estos peces no toleran nada bien	el frío, por lo que solo habitan en	las aguas del hemisferio sur.	Lo mejor que se puede hacer es no	acercar un dedo a sus mandíbulas	bajo ningún concepto.
"065"	Las rayas mueven sus aletas arriba	y abajo con tanta elegancia que	casi parecen volar bajo el agua.	Al verlas desde abajo, da la	impresión de que tienen una	sonrisa dibujada en la boca.	Algunas especies tienen un aguijón	en la base de la cola que suministra	un veneno mortífero.	Además son capaces de esconderse	bajo la arena, por lo que resultan	extremadamente peligrosas.
"066"	Los peces luna son una variedad	de peces globo que puede alcanzar	las dos toneladas de peso.	Una de las peculiaridades de su	anatomía es la falta de una aleta	que les ayude a desplazarse.	Pueden poner hasta 300 millones	de huevos, más que cualquier otro	animal vertebrado.	No obstante, de esos 300 millones	solo sobreviven uno o dos, así que	la pérdida es más que considerable.	Los peces luna a veces se asoman	a la superficie y se quedan en ella	como si tomaran el sol.	Debido a su tamaño tienen pocos	depredadores, entre ellos tiburones,	orcas y leones marinos.
"067"	El pez martillo es un tiburón	con la cabeza en forma de	martillo, de ahí su nombre.	Pese a su naturaleza de tiburón	son bastante tranquilos, por	increíble que parezca.	Tienen los ojos en los extremos	del "martillo", por lo que pueden	ver en casi todas las direcciones.	Curiosamente, tienen las fosas	nasales situadas muy cerca de	los ojos.	También presentan unos orificios	en las partes delantera e inferior	de la cabeza.	Les sirven para detectar a otros	animales, aunque estén escondidos	o fuera del campo de visión.	Se alimentan de todo tipo de peces,	pero las rayas son sus favoritos	con diferencia. ¡A por ellas!
"068"	Se cree que los dientes de los	tiburones evolucionaron en el	pasado a partir de escamas.	Cuando pierden uno lo sustituyen	rápidamente, así están siempre	listos para la caza.	Los tiburones son superpredadores,	lo cual quiere decir que están en la	cima de la cadena alimenticia.	Además de ser temibles bajo	el agua, algunos son capaces de	saltar por encima de ella.	El esqueleto de los tiburones está	hecho de cartílago, por lo que es	más flexible que nuestros huesos.
"069"	El nombre del pez sierra procede	de la forma de su cabeza, delgada,	larga y con dientes alrededor.	Tienen sensores debajo de la boca	con los que detectan a las presas	al estar en contacto con el fondo.	A veces agitan la "sierra" en medio	de bancos de peces y se alimentan	de todos los que han golpeado.
"070"	El tiburón ballena es el pez más	grande del mundo, pero también	uno de los más tranquilos y tímidos.	Nadan a unos 5 km/h, por lo que son	bastante lentos, y pese a su tamaño	distan de ser una amenaza.	Cuando abren la boca atrapan el	plancton y los demás organismos	diminutos de los que se alimentan.	De hecho, más que dientes tienen	unas 10 000 barbas dispuestas en	filas que actúan como filtros.
"071"	Los peces remo viven en el fondo	del mar y tienen una fina aleta roja	que recorre sus cuerpos plateados.	Pueden alcanzar los diez metros,	por lo que son indudablemente	grandes y muy llamativos.	Para nadar suelen agitar el cuerpo,	aunque también son capaces de	desplazarse en posición vertical.	Tienen la boca pequeña en relación	al cuerpo y carecen de dientes, por	lo que son bastante inofensivos.	Las aletas rojas de los peces remo	son parecidas al pelo y los hacen	fáciles de confundir con sirenas.
"072"	Los celacantos son unos peces	muy antiguos que se creían extintos	hasta que aparecieron en Sudáfrica.	Son unos auténticos fósiles	vivientes que han cambiado muy	poco en 400 millones de años.	Pueden vivir hasta sesenta años	y medir casi dos metros, pero	tienen el cerebro muy pequeño.	Poseen más aletas que un pez	normal y escamas más duras	que los hacen muy resistentes.	Además de tener muy mal sabor,	en sus cuerpos hay una grasa que	no puede digerir el ser humano.	En otras palabras, lo peor que	se puede hacer con ellos es	intentar comérselos.

"001"	Ce poisson vit dans les lacs et les	rivières. Il est si petit qu'il peut	tenir dans la paume de la main.{0000-0004-0000}
"002"	Ce poisson, apparenté à la carpe, se	distingue par ses longues nageoires	ventrales et sa bouche saillante.	Son habileté lui permet de sauter	pour attraper les insectes qui	passent au-dessus de l'eau.	Pour attirer les femelles lors de la	saison des amours, le ventre du	mâle devient rose et son dos, bleu.
"003"	Le carassin est une prise idéale pour	les débutants, mais les pêcheurs	confirmés l'apprécient également.	Apparenté à la carpe koï, il	peut vivre jusqu'à 15 ans.{0000-0004-0000}
"004"	Les vandoises peuvent vivre dans	des eaux relativement troubles et	vaseuses.	Cependant, leur nombre élevé	les rend facile à repérer.{0000-0004-0000}
"005"	Chez le barbeau, la distance entre	les yeux et la bouche est plus	grande que chez la carpe.	Cela donne l'impression qu'il baisse	les yeux avec embarras.{0000-0004-0000}
"006"	Ce poisson robuste peut vivre	plus de 100 ans.{0000-0004-0000}!
"007"	D'ordinaire de couleur assez terne,	ce poisson d'aquarium peut aussi	arborer des motifs variés.	L'élevage de carpes sélectionnées	pour leurs mutations génétiques	explique cette diversité.	Il n'existe pas deux carpes koï aux	motifs identiques, ce qui fait de	chaque spécimen un petit bijou.	En fonction du motif et de la	couleur, son prix peut atteindre	des sommets.	Élevée dans de bonnes conditions,	la carpe koï peut vivre plus de	100 ans.
"008"	Ce poisson d'aquarium est issu de	l'élevage sélectif du carassin.{0000-0004-0000}
"009"	Les yeux saillants qui ont rendu ce	poisson célèbre représentent en	fait un inconvénient.	En effet, il peut nager à côté d'une	proie sans la remarquer, mais aussi	se cogner, du fait de sa faible vue.
"010"	Les fondules barrés se déplacent	en banc dans des eaux douces	peu profondes.	Ils se nourrissent d'insectes	vivant à la surface de l'eau.{0000-0004-0000}
"011"	Cette cousine des homards vit dans	les étangs et les rivières, ce qui	la rend facile à attraper.	Son corps devient rouge si elle se	nourrit de végétaux, et bleu si elle	se nourrit de poissons.	Une couleur rouge indique un régime	plus équilibré et est donc préférée	chez cette espèce.
"012"	Cette cousine de la tortue commune	ne lâche jamais sa prise quand elle a	décidé de mordre quelque chose.	Elle est plutôt craintive, ce qui	explique son caractère assez	agressif au moindre danger.	Quand on se fait mordre, il suffit en	général de la remettre à l'eau pour	lui faire lâcher son étreinte.	Elle aime beaucoup nager, sa	carapace plate lui permettant	d'évoluer avec aisance.{0000-0004-0000}nA
"013"	Les têtards sont des bébés	grenouilles qui vivent dans	les étangs et les rivières.	Leur tête ronde et leur façon	de se déplacer les rendent aussi	attachants que les adultes.	Leur apparence finale se précise	quand leurs pattes poussent et	qu'ils perdent leur queue.	Dépourvus d'écaille à la différence	des poissons, ils exposent leur peau	directement et sont très fragiles.
"014"	Les grenouilles, dont le têtard est la	larve, vivent près des étangs et dans	des milieux marécageux.	Principalement terrestres, elles ne	possèdent pas de branchies, mais	des poumons et un épiderme.	Elles sécrètent un liquide qui leur	permet de protéger ce dernier de	la déshydratation.	En effet, un épiderme trop sec	les empêcherait de respirer	convenablement par ce biais.	Il est conseillé d'éviter de toucher	les grenouilles car certaines espèces	sont venimeuses.
"015"	Ce poisson trapu qui vit dans les	rivières a de nombreuses petites	dents pour déchiqueter ses proies.	La femelle creuse un trou sous un	rocher pour y déposer ses œufs	que le mâle est chargé de garder.	D'autres espèces tirent profit de ce	dévouement en pondant leurs œufs	au même endroit que cette espèce.
"016"	La loche d'étang vit dans les	eaux vaseuses des rivières.{0000-0004-0000}
"017"	Le silure est célèbre pour ses	élégantes moustaches, son large	corps et sa grande bouche.	Malgré ses yeux imposants,	il n'y voit pas grand-chose.{0000-0004-0000}
"018"	L'anguille naît dans l'océan avant	de remonter les rivières une fois	adulte.	Mais ce n'est que temporaire,	puisqu'elle finit par retourner dans	l'océan pour y pondre ses œufs.	Leur sang peut être toxique, ce qui	explique qu'on ne trouve pas de	sashimis d'anguille.	Une fois cuit, en revanche, ce	poisson devient parfaitement	comestible.	Le lieu de ponte et les habitudes	des anguilles ont longtemps	constitué une énigme.	Mais la recherche permet de lever	peu à peu le voile de ce fascinant	mystère.
"019"	Le tête-de-serpent doit son nom à	sa tête, aux motifs et aux écailles	qui font penser à ceux du serpent.	Il possède des dents acérées, il	convient donc de faire attention	à ses doigts si on le manipule.	Mâles et femelles sont réputés pour	la manière dont ils protègent leurs	œufs et leur progéniture.	En effet, ils se mettent à agiter leur	queue avec frénésie à l'approche	des prédateurs pour les faire fuir.
"020"	Le dos du crapet est recouvert de	nageoires en pointe qui lui servent	à se protéger des agressions.	De fait, sa progéniture bénéficie	d'un taux relativement élevé de	survie comparé aux autres poissons.	Le mâle chasse la femelle après la	ponte et se consacre à la protection	des œufs et des bébés.	Malgré une taille très inférieure,	le crapet est apparenté au bar.
"021"	La perche jaune est la cousine	du bar commun.{0000-0004-0000}t !
"022"	Le bar se dissimule généralement	au milieu des algues avant de jaillir	au passage d'une proie.	Sa tendance à effrayer ceux qui	s'approchent de ses petits lui vaut	une réputation de sauvage.	Apparenté au bar commun, il est	très apprécié en cuisine malgré la	forte odeur de sa peau.
"023"	Le brochet vit dans les eaux froides,	les eaux chaudes étant des lieux	inhospitaliers pour lui.	Il peut mesurer plus d'un mètre	et représente donc une prise de	choix pour les pêcheurs.	Ce prédateur redoutable possède	une mâchoire prognathe et une	large bouche aux dents acérées.	Celles-ci servent à déchiqueter les	poissons, mais aussi les oiseaux ou	d'autres créatures marines.
"024"	L'éperlan est un poisson vigoureux,	capable de survivre dans des eaux	de piètre qualité.	Il est apparenté au saumon et	possède tout comme lui des	mœurs migratoires.	Il quitte généralement les rivières	pour rejoindre les océans, avant de	retourner en eau douce.	Cependant, certains espèces vivent	dans des lacs sans connexion avec	l'océan et ne migrent donc pas.	Ses petites arêtes font qu'il	peut être mangé entier, grillé	ou en beignet.
"025"	L'ayu est un poisson migrateur qui	quitte sa rivière natale pour l'océan,	puis revient frayer en eau douce.	Ce mode de vie le rapproche des	saumons.{0000-0004-0000}Q
"026"	Les taches qui recouvrent le corps	du saumon rose lui servent de	camouflage.	Il vit en général dans les rivières	mais il lui arrive de migrer vers	l'océan pour achever sa croissance.	Les pêcheurs apprécient ce poisson	pour ses formes harmonieuses et	ses motifs élégants.	En outre, leur nature nerveuse les	rend difficile à attraper, ajoutant au	prestige accompagnant leur prise.
"027"	L'omble est apparenté au saumon.	Il vit dans les rivières et ne migre	que rarement vers l'océan.	Préférant les eaux froides, il habite	dans les eaux claires, au fond de	rivières isolées dans les montagnes.	Sa tendance à se dissimuler entre	les rochers le rend d'autant plus	difficile à observer.
"028"	Au cours de sa croissance, la truite	développe une bande rose qui court	de sa queue à ses ouïes.	Certains individus passent leur vie	dans les rivières tandis que d'autres	choisissent de vivre dans l'océan.	La truite est la représentante d'une	espèce majeure de poissons, mais	est dure à trouver en milieu naturel.
"029"	Le dai yu vit dans les rivières	froides. Ce poisson corpulent peut	mesurer plus d'un mètre de long.	Il peut vivre jusqu'à 20 ans mais sa	croissance est si lente qu'il lui en	faut 15 pour atteindre sa maturité.	C'est un poisson assez rare et	difficile à observer en milieu	naturel, surtout à l'état adulte.
"030"	Le saumon est un poisson migrateur	qui naît dans les rivières avant de	migrer vers l'océan.	Après quatre ans, il retourne dans	les rivières pour se reproduire.{0000-0004-0000}Q
"031"	Le saumon roi peut mesurer deux	fois la taille d'un saumon ordinaire,	ce qui justifie son nom.	Dans certaines régions, il retourne	dans les rivières au printemps ou en	été pour y frayer l'automne venu.	La chair du saumon roi peut être	blanche, mais la chair rose est	beaucoup plus appréciée.
"032"	On appelle également cette espèce	« crabe poilu de Shanghai ».{0000-0004-0000}
"033"	Le guppy est apparenté au fondule	barré et vit dans les rivières	chaudes des tropiques.	Poisson apprécié des aquariophiles,	sa longue nageoire caudale est le	résultat de croisements.	Le guppy femelle donne naissance	à sa progéniture après que les œufs	ont éclos dans son ventre.	Le rythme des naissances étant	constant, la population croît à une	vitesse assez élevée.
"034"	Le nom scientifique du poisson	docteur est « garra rufa ». Il vit	dans les rivières chaudes.	Omnivore, il se nourrit aussi bien	d'algues que de la peau d'autres	poissons.	Il suffit de plonger sa main dans	l'eau pour que ce poisson vienne la	débarrasser de ses peaux mortes.	C'est cette vertu exfoliante qui	lui a valu son nom.
"035"	Ce poisson tropical se déplace avec	grâce du fait des longues nageoires	situées sur son dos et son ventre.	Il est très difficile de distinguer	le mâle de la femelle.{0000-0004-0000}
"036"	Le néon bleu doit son nom à la	magnifique ligne bleu métallique	qui orne son corps.	Sa nature timide et docile ne laisse	pas paraître qu'il s'agit d'un lointain	cousin du piranha.	Il possède des dents fines et	tranchantes qui contrastent	avec son apparence féérique.	Ce poisson est très sensible à	la propreté et à la température	de l'eau.
"037"	Le piranha doit sa réputation à	ses dents acérées qui lui donnent	cet air féroce.	Pourtant, il est d'une nature plutôt	timide, malgré sa dangerosité bien	réelle.	À défaut d'une autre proie, il peut	avoir recours au cannibalisme.{0000-0004-0000}
"038"	L'arowana est un poisson très	ancien, dont la forme n'a que peu	évolué en 100 millions d'années.	Il est connu pour ses larges écailles	ainsi que pour les poils qui sortent	de sa mâchoire inférieure.	Il est très agile et peut sauter	à plus d'un mètre au-dessus de	la surface de l'eau.	Le mâle garde sa progéniture	dans sa bouche pour la protéger.{0000-0004-0000}Q
"039"	« Dorade » provient de l'espagnol	« dorado » qui signifie « doré ».{0000-0004-0000}
"040"	Le long museau du gar et sa	large bouche lui donnent des	airs d'alligator.	Certains individus peuvent	atteindre trois mètres de long.{0000-0004-0000}
"041"	L'arapaïma, apparu il y a 100	millions d'années, peut mesurer	plus de deux mètres de long.{0000-0004-0000}
"042"	Le bichir possède des nageoires	dorsales en forme de piquants.{0000-0004-0000}
"043"	La clione se laisse porter par le	courant, au milieu des icebergs.{0000-0004-0000}!
"044"	L'hippocampe ne ressemble pas à	un poisson mais présente beaucoup	de points communs avec lui.	Il utilise ses nageoires dorsale et	caudale pour se mouvoir, mais	c'est un piètre nageur.	Pour ne pas se laisser emporter par	le courant, il s'agrippe aux algues	ou aux coraux à l'aide de sa queue.	Ainsi accroché, il se nourrit de	plancton et de petites crevettes	qui flottent à portée.	La femelle dépose ses œufs dans la	poche ventrale du mâle qui est dès	lors chargé de leur incubation.
"045"	Le poisson-clown passe sa vie	dissimulé parmi les tentacules des	anémones de mer.	Il est le seul à pouvoir s'y nicher,	sa peau sécrétant une protection	contre le poison de son habitat.	En échange de la protection de	l'anémone de mer, il en chasse les	parasites et les prédateurs.	Tous les poissons-clowns naissent	mâles mais ils peuvent changer de	sexe en cas de manque de femelles.
"046"	Le poisson chirurgien se distingue	par sa nageoire caudale jaune et	son corps d'un bleu éclatant.	Il est d'une nature plutôt timide	et tranquille.{0000-0004-0000}
"047"	Le poisson-papillon est très	apprécié des aquariophiles	pour sa beauté.	Il se meut avec grâce dans les eaux	chaudes en agitant ses nageoires à	la manière d'un papillon.	Son régime est très spartiate	puisqu'il se nourrit de corail et	d'anémones toxiques.	On a pu voir des poissons-papillons	vivant en couple depuis 10 ans et	plus.	Ils se déplacent souvent deux par	deux, ce qui leur confère une image	très romantique.
"048"	Le napoléon est facile à reconnaître	grâce à la bosse qui orne sa tête.{0000-0004-0000}
"049"	Le poisson-scorpion possède de	longues nageoires qui flottent	élégamment autour de lui.	Mais qu'on ne s'y trompe pas :	ces merveilles dissimulent des	piquants venimeux.	Leur poison sert aussi bien de	protection contre les prédateurs	que lors des joutes entre mâles.	Ces dernières sont sans pitié	puisque le mâle vaincu succombe	au poison en quelques jours.
"050"	Le poisson-ballon est considéré	comme un mets délicat, malgré	le poison qu'il renferme.	Il est plus sûr de consommer de	jeunes poissons-ballons car ils ne	sont pas encore toxiques.	Ce n'est qu'après avoir ingéré assez	de nourriture et de microbes marins	qu'ils le deviennent.	En cas de danger, ce poisson se	gonfle comme un ballon en aspirant	de l'eau et de l'air.	Un prédateur cherchant à saisir une	proie si volumineuse risque alors de	mordre dans un piquant venimeux.
"051"	Comme son nom l'indique, le	poisson-porc-épic est recouvert	de piquants.	Il est apparenté au poisson-ballon,	mais à l'inverse de celui-ci, il n'est	pas venimeux.	On prétend souvent qu'il possède	1 000 piquants, mais le nombre réel	est plutôt de 300 ou 400.	En cas de danger, il se gonfle en	aspirant de l'eau et de l'air afin	d'intimider ses prédateurs.
"052"	Le chinchard est un mets apprécié	depuis longtemps pour ses qualités	gustatives et son prix abordable.	Cependant, dans certaines régions,	il est considéré comme un plat	de gourmet.	Ses écailles sont très dures et	elles doivent être retirées avant	la cuisson.	Malgré sa taille, le chinchard est un	carnivore vorace.{0000-0004-0000}
"053"	Le scarus est reconnaissable aux	sept rayures qui ornent son corps	blanc.	Sa curiosité naturelle et sa force	en font une prise recherchée par les	pêcheurs, mais il est dur à attraper.	Ses dents robustes lui permettent	de venir à bout rapidement des	coquilles les plus résistantes.	Oursins et mollusques ont donc	fort à craindre de ce redoutable	prédateur.
"054"	Le bar commun est connu pour	sa chair délicieuse ainsi que pour	sa taille.	S'il avale quelque chose qui n'est	pas comestible, il ouvre la bouche	et ses ouïes puis secoue la tête.	Ce mouvement, aussi étrange qu'il	puisse paraître, suffit généralement	à expulser le corps étranger.	Comme son cousin le bar, il possède	une force qui constitue un vrai défi	pour les pêcheurs.
"055"	Le vivaneau est un poisson grégaire	qui se déplace souvent en bancs	près des récifs et des épaves.	Ce poisson est très consommé et du	fait de la demande, on sert souvent	d'autres espèces sous son nom.	Il peut vivre jusqu'à 50 ans.	Le record serait même de 57 ans.
"056"	Généralement, les deux yeux de	la limande se situent sur son côté	droit, mais il y a des exceptions.	Dans tous les cas, cependant, les	individus jeunes ont un œil de	chaque côté du corps.	Lors de la croissance, l'œil gauche	migre habituellement vers le côté	droit.	La limande creuse le sable pour s'y	cacher, et elle laisse dépasser un	œil pour surveiller les alentours.	Elle se nourrit de petites créatures	à l'aide de sa bouche étroite,	remplie de dents chétives.
"057"	Les deux yeux du cardeau se	trouvent sur son côté gauche.{0000-0004-0000}
"058"	Le calmar possède 10 bras, dont	deux lui servent à attraper ses	proies.	Pour nager, il agite ses nageoires	et expulse l'eau qui se trouve à	l'intérieur de son corps.	L'encre qu'il projette en cas de	danger prend la forme d'un calmar,	et sert à leurrer son attaquant.
"059"	On ne voit souvent de la murène	que sa tête qui dépasse d'entre	les rochers.	Lorsqu'une proie s'approche, elle se	jette hors de sa cachette et la saisit	avec sa bouche aux dents acérées.	La morsure de la murène peut être	redoutable car il est dur de lui faire	lâcher prise.	Son corps longiligne est couvert	d'une peau rigide souvent utilisée	comme cuir.
"060"	En observant la murène ruban bleue,	on a l'impression qu'une fleur lui	pousse sur le museau.	Elle doit son nom à sa couleur	bleu vif ainsi qu'à l'aspect effilé	de son corps.	Elle naît asexuée et devient	mâle puis femelle au cours de	sa croissance.	Elle sort souvent la tête de son	trou dans le sable en ouvrant la	bouche.	Ce n'est pas pour effrayer	un éventuel prédateur, mais	simplement pour respirer.	Malgré son apparence un peu	effrayante, la murène ruban bleue	est un poisson très paisible.
"061"	Le poisson lanterne vit dans les	abysses, loin de la lumière.{0000-0004-0000}
"062"	Le thon peut mesurer près de	trois mètres et peser plus de	400 kilogrammes.	Une telle taille combinée à un goût	délicat font de ce poisson une prise	de choix pour les pêcheurs.	Le thon ne peut pas respirer quand	il est immobile, il est donc obligé de	se mouvoir constamment.	Ainsi, pour dormir, il se contente	de ralentir.{0000-0004-0000}ir, a
"063"	Le marlin bleu est connu pour son	long museau en forme d'épée.{0000-0004-0000}
"064"	La carangue grosse tête	appartient à la famille des	maquereaux.	Elle se distingue cependant par sa	taille et la teinte argentée de son	corps.{0000-0004-0000}laA
"065"	En agitant ses larges nageoires	comme si elle battait des ailes, la	raie donne l'impression de voler.	Vue du dessous, la raie semble	sourire.{0000-0004-0000}Q
"066"	La lune de mer est apparentée au	poisson-ballon et peut atteindre un	poids de deux tonnes.	Dénuée de nageoire caudale, elle	ne nage pas très vite, ce qui peut	apparaître comme un désavantage.	Mais elle a d'autres atouts : elle	peut pondre 300 millions d'œufs,	un record chez les poissons.	Cependant, sur ce nombre	impressionnant, seul un ou deux	individus parviennent à survivre.	La lune de mer aime parfois se	prélasser à la surface de l'eau,	comme si elle bronzait.
"067"	Le requin marteau doit son nom	à la forme de sa tête. Pour un	requin, il est plutôt paisible.	La position de ses yeux lui	permet de voir dans presque	toutes les directions.	Étrangement, ses narines se	situent près de ses yeux, aux	deux extrémités de sa tête.	Il possède également des petites	ouvertures sur le devant et le bas	de la tête.	Celles-ci lui permettent de détecter	les proies, même celles situées sous	lui ou hors de son champ de vision.	Il semble que la raie constitue sa	nourriture favorite.
"068"	Il semblerait que les dents	triangulaires du requin aient	été des écailles à l'origine.	Lorsque l'une de ces dents se	casse, elle tombe rapidement et	est remplacée par une nouvelle.	C'est un prédateur redoutable,	capable de flairer l'odeur du sang	à plusieurs kilomètres à la ronde.	Il peut même sauter hors de l'eau	pour attraper une proie.{0000-0004-0000}Q
"069"	Le requin scie doit son nom à la	forme de sa tête hérissée de dents	telle une lame de tronçonneuse.	Pour détecter une proie, il se colle	contre le fond marin et utilise ses	capteurs situés sous sa bouche.	Il agite parfois sa gueule au milieu	d'un banc de poissons et attrape	les proies qu'il a ainsi atteintes.
"070"	Le requin-baleine est le plus grand	poisson du monde et peut-être	aussi l'un des plus pacifiques.	Il ne nage qu'à 5 km/h, ce qui le	rend plutôt inoffensif en dépit	de sa taille.	Il se déplace la bouche ouverte	pour avaler des grandes quantités	d'eau contenant de petits animaux.	L'eau est ensuite filtrée par ses	ouïes et la nourriture restante est	avalée.{0000-0004-0000} A
"071"	Le poisson-ruban vit dans les	profondeurs. Son corps argenté	peut atteindre 10 mètres de long.	Il nage habituellement en faisant	onduler son corps étroit, mais il	peut aussi nager à la verticale.	Sa gueule est petite comparée à son	corps, et ne possède pas de dents.{0000-0004-0000}
"072"	On pensait le cœlacanthe éteint	avant qu'on en trouve un spécimen	vivant au large de l'Afrique.	Surnommé « fossile vivant », il ne	semble pas avoir évolué beaucoup	en 400 millions d'années.	Il peut vivre plus de 60 ans et	atteindre une taille de 2 mètres.{0000-0004-0000}

"001"	I rodei sono pesci così piccoli	che possono stare nel palmo	di una mano.	Durante la stagione degli amori,	il ventre del maschio diventa	rosa per attrarre una compagna.	Vivono in acqua dolce e depongono	le uova in grandi bivalvi nei quali i	piccoli vivranno per qualche tempo.
"002"	I ciprinidi sono parenti delle carpe.	Si distinguono per le lunghe pinne	ventrali e per la bocca sporgente.	Sono in grado di effettuare grandi	salti per afferrare gli insetti che	si trovano vicino alla superficie.	Sono dei pesci molto attivi e sono	conosciuti per il loro carattere	spiccatamente aggressivo.	Durante la stagione degli amori,	il ventre del maschio diventa rosa	mentre il dorso tende al blu.
"003"	Il carassio è un pesce facile da	catturare per i principianti, ma	è apprezzato anche dagli esperti.	È parente stretto della koi ed è	in grado di vivere fino a 20 anni.	È ottimo per l'allevamento.	Nascono soprattutto esemplari	femmina e questo è un grosso	problema per la loro diffusione.	Fortunatamente, le femmine	sono in grado di riprodursi	con maschi di altre specie.
"004"	Le lasche vivono in acque torbide,	ma sono facili da avvistare perché	formano gruppi numerosi.	Sono parenti delle carpe, anche	se alcune specie di lasca vivono	in acque salate.	Durante la stagione degli amori,	sul ventre del maschio appare	una striscia di colore arancione.
"005"	Nel barbo, la distanza tra gli occhi	e la bocca è maggiore rispetto	a quella che presenta la carpa.	A causa di questa caratteristica,	sembra quasi che abbassi	lo sguardo per l'imbarazzo.	I loro barbigli sono più corti di	quelli delle carpe. Tutto sommato,	le similitudini non sono molte.	Sono pieni di ossa, ma sono	comunque commestibili. Il sapore	ricorda quello dell'halibut.
"006"	Le carpe possono vivere molto	a lungo. Alcuni esemplari riescono	a raggiungere i 100 anni di vita.	I loro caratteristici barbigli	sono ben visibili e le rendono	molto facili da identificare.	Sono onnivore e si nutrono, per	esempio, di alghe e insetti che	catturano aspirandoli con la bocca.	Nella loro gola, vivono dei batteri	che le aiutano nella digestione	dei molluschi.
"007"	Le koi sono pesci da acquario dai	colori talvolta pallidi, talvolta	estremamente gradevoli.	Questo grazie a un allevamento	mirato degli esemplari in cui sono	avvenute delle mutazioni genetiche.	Ogni koi possiede un motivo	unico sulla livrea. Non esistono	due esemplari identici tra loro.	In base al colore e al motivo delle	loro macchie, possono essere	vendute a un prezzo molto elevato.	Possono vivere più di 100 anni.	Per questo, sono ideali per essere	tenute in laghetti ornamentali.
"008"	I pesci rossi sono pesci da acquario	ottenuti grazie all'allevamento	selettivo di alcuni tipi di carassio.	Sono stati necessari secoli per	ottenere la lunga coda e il colore	pregevole della razza attuale.	Quando sono piccoli, i pesci rossi	sono di colore nero e possiedono	diversi tratti tipici del carassio.	Durante lo sviluppo, assumono	il tipico colore rosso per cui	sono conosciuti.
"009"	Il pesce telescopio è conosciuto	per i suoi occhi telescopici. Questa	caratteristica è in realtà un difetto.	Questo pesce possiede una pessima	vista e spesso non è in grado	di vedere il cibo o gli ostacoli.	Si tratta di un tipo di pesce rosso.	I caratteristici occhi sporgenti	appaiono solo dopo i primi mesi.
"010"	I killifish sono piccoli e vivono in	banchi. In giapponese vengono	chiamati "medaka" (occhi alti).	Vivono nelle acque poco profonde	dei fiumi e si nutrono degli insetti	che si trovano sul pelo dell'acqua.	Proprio per questa ragione,	la loro bocca è situata alla	stessa altezza dei loro occhi.	La loro temperatura corporea	coincide con quella dell'acqua	nella quale vivono.	Per questo, se vengono afferrati a	mani nude, il calore di queste ultime	può provocare loro uno shock.
"011"	I gamberi sono parenti stretti	dei gamberetti. Vengono spesso	trovati in stagni, fiumi e risaie.	Questo è dovuto al fatto che	questi animali sono molto numerosi	e mangiano qualsiasi cosa.	Se mangiano piante, il loro corpo	diventa rosso e se mangiano	carne diventano di colore blu.	Quando un gambero è rosso	significa che sta seguendo	una dieta sana e bilanciata.
"012"	L'apalone ferox è una parente della	tartaruga comune e, quando morde	qualcosa, non lascia andare la preda.	Questo comportamento ossessivo	nasce dallo scarso coraggio	di questa specie animale.	Passa molto tempo in acqua e	grazie alla forma del suo guscio	è un'ottima nuotatrice.	Quando nuota, l'apalone ferox	tiene il muso fuori dall'acqua	in modo da poter respirare.	È pericoloso tenerne in mano	una, perché tende a mordere	al minimo movimento.	Fortunatamente, in caso di morso,	l'apalone ferox lascerà la presa	se viene posta di nuovo in acqua.
"013"	I girini sono semplicemente dei	cuccioli di rana. Vivono solitamente	negli stagni e nelle risaie.	Sono considerati di aspetto più	gradevole delle rane per la loro	testa rotonda e i loro movimenti.	Assumono un aspetto più simile a	quello delle rane quando perdono	la coda e acquisiscono delle zampe.	Al contrario dei pesci, non hanno	squame e la loro pelle è molto	delicata. Attenzione a maneggiarli.
"014"	Le rane sono girini cresciutelli.	Prediligono i luoghi umidi e paludosi	come, ad esempio, gli stagni.	Vivono sulla terraferma e quindi	per respirare si servono dei	polmoni anziché delle branchie.	Ad ogni modo, hanno bisogno	di molta umidità. Per questo	vivono comunque vicino all'acqua.	Se la loro pelle non è abbastanza	umida, hanno problemi a respirare	perché perdono troppa acqua.	Per questo le rane secernono una	sostanza umida che impedisce	alla loro pelle di seccarsi.	È bene evitare di prenderle in mano	perché alcune specie sono	velenose anche al tocco.
"015"	I ghiozzi sono pesci corti e tozzi.	Possiedono denti fini e taglienti	adatti a divorare altri pesci.	Sono soliti scavare dei buchi sotto	le rocce che si trovano sul letto del	fiume per deporre lì le loro uova.	I maschi hanno il compito di	proteggere le uova, mettendosi	essi stessi a guardia dei nidi.	Altre specie di pesci approfittano	di questa protezione e depongono	le loro uova nei nidi di ghiozzi.
"016"	I cobiti sono pesci di piccole	dimensioni che vivono nelle	risaie e nelle acque torbide.	Possiedono dieci barbigli intorno	alla bocca con papille gustative	per sentire il dolce e l'amaro.	Una caratteristica particolare di	questa specie è la sua capacità di	respirare anche tramite l'intestino.	I cobiti portano la bocca in	superficie per inspirare mentre	sono in grado di espirare dalla coda.	In Giappone, è molto popolare	lo stufato di cobite e radice	di gobo con uova sbattute.
"017"	I pesci gatto si riconoscono	dai loro barbigli, la loro forma	particolare e la loro grande bocca.	Anche se possiedono degli occhi	molto grandi, vedono poco ed	escono soprattutto di notte.	Sul corpo presentano delle	particolari linee orizzontali e	verticali, simili a linee tratteggiate.	Servono per percepire le deboli	correnti elettriche che provengono	dagli altri pesci e cacciarli.	I pesci gatto sono dei carnivori	particolari: nuotano pigramente,	ma poi colpiscono con rapidità.
"018"	Le anguille nascono in mare	e da adulte percorrono i fiumi	nuotando verso la sorgente.	Quando giunge il momento	di deporre le uova, le anguille	ritornano in mare.	Il loro sangue contiene veleno,	per questo sarebbe troppo	pericoloso mangiarle crude.	L'anguilla cotta, invece, non è	velenosa ed è, anzi, un piatto	molto apprezzato.	Le abitudini delle anguille e la	posizione dei loro nidi sono rimaste	un mistero per molto tempo.	Grazie a varie ricerche ne sappiamo	sempre di più e lo studio delle	anguille è più diffuso che mai.
"019"	Il pesce serpente viene chiamato	così a causa della sua testa, che	assomiglia a quella di un serpente.	Anche le squame e il motivo	sulla sua livrea assomigliano	a quelli di un serpente.	Possiede denti aguzzi ed è	consigliabile non avvicinare	le dita alla sua bocca.	Sia il maschio che la femmina	difendono strenuamente	le loro uova e i loro piccoli.	Se un altro pesce si avvicina,	agitano freneticamente	la coda per allontanarlo.
"020"	Il pesce persico presenta delle	spine sulle pinne dorsali che hanno	lo scopo di difenderlo dai predatori.	Rispetto ad altri pesci,	i suoi piccoli hanno una buona	percentuale di sopravvivenza.	Questo succede perché la	difesa delle uova e dei piccoli	è affidata ai maschi.	Il pesce persico è di dimensioni	abbastanza piccole, eppure	è un parente stretto del boccalone.
"021"	La perca dorata appartiene alla	famiglia delle spigole ed è preda	di grossi pesci, come il boccalone.	Si riconosce per le sue grandi	e spinose pinne dorsali, nonché per	le strisce grigie sulla livrea gialla.	Questo pesce vive negli Stati Uniti	e in Canada, dove viene pescato	nei laghi ghiacciati.	Spesso consumata fritta,	rappresenta un piatto semplice,	ma molto gustoso.
"022"	In inglese, il boccalone viene	chiamato "spigola nera" a causa	del suo colore nero e verdastro.	Quando caccia, si nasconde	tra le alghe attendendo l'arrivo	di altri pesci e poi colpisce.	È un pesce molto forte e	per questo molti pescatori	adoperano l'esca.	Si dice "boccalone" di una	persona molto ingenua, ma	questo pesce non lo è affatto.	Il maschio difende aggressivamente	le uova e i piccoli spaventando	gli eventuali predatori.	I boccaloni sono parenti delle	spigole. Sono saporiti, anche se	la pelle emana un forte odore.
"023"	I lucci nordici si trovano solitamente	in acque molto fredde perché non	possono sopravvivere dove fa caldo.	Possono raggiungere il metro	di lunghezza. Per questo sono	molto ricercati dai pescatori.	Sono temibili predatori poiché	possiedono una mascella sporgente,	una bocca grande e denti aguzzi.	Con i loro denti afferrano non solo	altri pesci, ma anche uccelli e altre	creature marine. Fai attenzione!
"024"	Il pingo è un pesce piccolo ed	energico in grado di sopravvivere	anche in acque poco pulite.	Tuttavia, vive solamente uno	o due anni, anche se trova	habitat del tutto favorevoli.	Il pingo è un parente del salmone	e infatti possiede le sue stesse	tendenze migratorie.	Molti esemplari nuotano dal	fiume verso il mare per poi tornare	a vivere in acque dolci.	Alcuni di loro, però, vivono	in laghi privi di sbocco al mare,	pertanto non migrano.	In molti luoghi, la pesca sul	ghiaccio del pingo è un'attività	invernale molto diffusa.	Le loro piccole pinne li rendono	perfetti per essere grigliati	o impanati e fritti.
"025"	L'ayu è un pesce migratorio che si	dirige verso il mare quando cresce	e torna al fiume per riprodursi.	Questo comportamento	sottolinea che l'ayu è un	parente stretto del salmone.	Gli esemplari adulti hanno un odore	particolare dato dal muschio	del fiume di cui si cibano.	Gli ayu difendono in modo	aggressivo il proprio territorio	attaccando i rivali che si avvicinano.	I pescatori sfruttano la loro	aggressività usando esche	che assomigliano ad altri ayu.
"026"	Le macchie sulla livrea del salmone	giapponese servono al mimetismo	e sono comuni a tutti i salmoni.	La maggior parte degli esemplari	vivono nei fiumi, ma alcuni si recano	in mare prima di diventare adulti.	I salmoni giapponesi migratori	vengono comunemente chiamati	"salmoni masu".	Sono molto ricercati dai pescatori	per il loro fisico bilanciato	e per i loro bellissimi motivi.	Sono di natura molto nervosi	e riuscire a catturarli può	dare grandi soddisfazioni.
"027"	I salmerini alpini vivono vicino alla	sorgente, come i salmoni; tuttavia,	non si recano mai in mare.	Preferiscono acque più fredde,	pertanto vivono sulle montagne,	in acque limpide e in zone recluse.	Si nascondono tra le rocce	e pertanto possono essere	difficili da individuare.
"028"	Quando la trota iridea raggiunge lo	stadio adulto, sviluppa una banda	rosa che va dalle branchie alla coda.	Alcuni esemplari trascorrono	tutta la loro vita nei fiumi	mentre altri vivono nel mare.	La trota steelhead è parente stretta	della trota iridea, ma vive nel mare	e si riproduce in acqua dolce.	La trota iridea è molto comune,	ma solo pochi esemplari vivono	nel loro habitat naturale.
"029"	Gli sperlani vivono in fiumi freddi,	possono crescere fino a un metro	e sono di taglia grossa e robusta.	Vivono fino a 20 anni, ma crescono	così lentamente che raggiungono	la maturità solo dopo 15 anni.	Ne sono rimasti davvero	pochi. Gli esemplari adulti sono	particolarmente difficili da trovare.
"030"	Il salmone è un pesce migratore	che nasce nei fiumi e migra verso il	mare per tornare dopo quattro anni.	In alcuni casi, il salmone vive nel	mare solo per un anno o due prima	di tornare in acqua dolce.	Questa specie è molto apprezzata	perché presenta un sapore	particolarmente buono.	In Giappone, le uova di salmone	si chiamano "ikura" e sono	un cibo molto diffuso.	Il rosa caratteristico di questo	pesce deriva dalla sua dieta	ricca di gamberetti.	Se non mangiasse gamberetti,	il colore del salmone sarebbe	invece completamente bianco.
"031"	I salmoni reali prendono questo	nome perché raggiungono il doppio	della lunghezza dei salmoni.	Questo pesce è conosciuto	anche con altri nomi, per esempio	Red King e salmone Chinook.	In alcune zone, torna nei fiumi in	primavera ed estate e vi resta fino	all'autunno, quando depone le uova.	La carne del salmone reale può	anche essere completamente bianca.	Questa varietà è meno apprezzata.
"032"	Il granchio guantato è anche detto	"granchio cinese d'acqua dolce"	o "granchio cinese del guanto".	È molto usato nella cucina	cinese e per questa ragione	è conosciuto in tutto il mondo.	Ha un ciclo vitale opposto	a quello del salmone; infatti	nasce nel mare.	Si reca in acqua dolce per	raggiungere lo stadio adulto e	torna nel mare per riprodursi.	Secondo molte persone, le chiazze	di peli che si trovano sulle sue	chele somigliano a delle alghe.
"033"	I guppy sono pesci tropicali	che vivono in fiumi caldi.	Sono parenti stretti dei killifish.	Questi pesci molto amati sono stati	allevati in modo che avessero delle	lunghe e spettacolari pinne caudali.	Le uova dei guppy si schiudono	nel ventre della madre che dà	poi luce ai piccoli.	Si riproducono diverse volte	all'anno e, per questo, vantano	un elevato numero di esemplari.
"034"	La garra rufa vive in acque	abbastanza calde ed è nota anche	con il nome di "pesce dottore".	È un pesce onnivoro che si nutre	sia di alghe che della pelle	morta degli altri pesci.	Per nutrirlo, basta immergere	una mano nell'acqua. Il pesce	mangerà la pelle morta della mano.	Non avendo denti, riesce a esfoliare	senza fare male e proprio per	questo viene chiamato "dottore".
"035"	Il bellissimo pesce angelo si muove	in modo aggraziato grazie alle	lunghe pinne dorsali e ventrali.	Gli esemplari maschi e le femmine	sono quasi identici e questo rende	molto difficile distinguerli.	Depongono le loro uova all'interno	di piante acquatiche ed entrambi	i genitori si occupano dei piccoli.	Questi assumono l'aspetto dei	pesci angelo soltanto quando sono	pronti per staccarsi dalle piante.
"036"	I pesci neon prendono il loro nome	dalla bellissima linea blu metallica	presente sulla loro livrea.	Anche se sono parenti dei piranha,	sono in realtà dei pesci di carattere	gentile e pavido.	Hanno denti sottili e appuntiti.	Questo spiega la loro strana	parentela con i piranha.	Sono pesci molto delicati: sono	sensibili sia alla pulizia che	alla temperatura dell'acqua.
"037"	I piranha hanno una reputazione	di pesci feroci a causa dei loro	terrificanti denti aguzzi.	Stranamente, sono in realtà dei	pesci abbastanza timidi, anche	se restano molto pericolosi.	Se non trovano cibo, divoreranno	qualsiasi animale che riescono a	trovare o si mangeranno tra loro!	Bisogna fare attenzione quando	si prendono in mano perché	potrebbero mordere!
"038"	L'arowana è un pesce antico che	è rimasto praticamente immutato	per 100 milioni di anni.	Si riconosce dalle grandi	squame e dai peli che spuntano	dal labbro inferiore.	Gli arowana sono in grado di saltare	anche fino a un metro di altezza	oltre la superficie dell'acqua.	I maschi tengono i piccoli in bocca	e li lasciano andare solo quando	sono abbastanza grandi.
"039"	In inglese, la corifena si chiama	"dorado", a causa del suo	colore dorato con puntini neri.	Anche se assomiglia a un salmone,	la corifena possiede denti molto	aguzzi ed è parente dei piranha.	È un pesce talmente feroce che gli	altri pesci, se lo vedono, scappano	per paura di essere divorati.	La sua forza e la sua natura	aggressiva ne fanno una preda	ambita dai pescatori.
"040"	Con la lunga testa, una grande bocca	e una lunghezza di quasi 3 m,	il luccio può sembrare un alligatore.	Si tratta di un pesce antico che	non è cambiato fin da quando è	apparso, milioni di anni fa.	Non respira solo con le branchie,	ma anche mettendo la bocca	fuori dall'acqua.	Le uova del luccio sono velenose	e per questo non devono essere	assolutamente mangiate.
"041"	Il pirarucù è uno dei pesci di acqua	dolce più grandi del mondo.	È lungo più di 2 m.	Si tratta si un pesce antico	che si ritiene esista da	oltre 100 milioni di anni.	Respira con le branchie, ma	anche prendendo aria con	la bocca fuori dall'acqua.	Possiede una lingua dura e ruvida	che utilizza per spezzettare	i pesci più piccoli che mangia.
"042"	Il polipteride è un pesce molto	antico che possiede delle	pinne dorsali dotate di punte.	Questa specie esiste da 400 milioni	di anni ed è rimasta relativamente	immutata nel tempo.	Ricorda in qualche modo i dinosauri	perché nuota lentamente usando	le pinne ventrali per "camminare".	Oltre ad essere antico, è anche	un pesce abbastanza grande.	Può superare i 70 cm di lunghezza.	È molto vorace e resta a lungo in	attesa di attaccare qualsiasi pesce	possa entrare nella sua bocca.
"043"	Le cavolinie seguono la corrente	delle fredde acque invernali	nuotando tra le lastre di ghiaccio.	Hanno un modo affascinante	di nuotare utilizzando le loro	pinne simili ad ali.	Non a caso il nome inglese di	questa specie è "sea butterfly",	ovvero "farfalla di mare".	Le cavolinie hanno una tattica	tutta speciale per procurarsi	da mangiare.	La loro testa si apre e da essa	fuoriescono sei tentacoli speciali	con cui afferrano la preda.
"044"	Gli ippocampi non assomigliano	ai pesci, eppure hanno molti	aspetti in comune con loro.	Nuotano usando le loro piccole	pinne dorsali e le pinne caudali,	ma non sono abili nuotatori.	Per non farsi trasportare dalla	corrente, si allacciano alle alghe	o al corallo con le pinne della coda.	Una volta attaccati, si nutrono	del plancton e dei gamberetti	trasportati dalla corrente.	Le femmine depositano le uova nella	sacca del maschio, che sarà l'unico	responsabile di farle schiudere.
"045"	Il pesce pagliaccio vive	nascondendosi tra i tentacoli	dell'anemone di mare.	Questi sono velenosi, ma il pesce	pagliaccio produce del muco	che lo ricopre e lo rende immune.	In cambio della protezione	dai predatori, il pesce scaccia	i parassiti dell'anemone di mare.	I pesci pagliaccio nascono tutti	maschi, ma se necessario, sono in	grado di trasformarsi in femmine.
"046"	Il pesce chirurgo possiede	una livrea blu a righe nere	e un'incantevole coda gialla.	Questo elegante pesce tropicale	è di natura piuttosto mite	e non troppo coraggiosa.	Per proteggersi dai predatori,	i pesci chirurgo dormono nei piccoli	spazi tra le rocce o nel corallo.	Se si sentono in pericolo,	si mettono su un fianco	e fingono di essere morti.
"047"	I pesci farfalla sono davvero	incantevoli e per questo sono molto	popolari come animali domestici.	Sono di colore giallo, vivono	in acque calde e nuotano come	se fossero davvero delle farfalle.	Hanno una dieta molto particolare.	Si nutrono di duro corallo e dei	velenosi anemoni di mare.	Le coppie di pesci farfalla	possono vivere insieme	anche per più di dieci anni.	Infatti, spesso vengono	visti nuotare in coppia in	un'immagine molto romantica.
"048"	Il pesce napoleone appartiene alla	famiglia dei cheilinus e il suo nome	scientifico è "cheilinus undulatus".	Alla nascita, tutti gli esemplari	sono femmine e alcuni diventano	maschi durante lo sviluppo.	Con l'età, la protuberanza sulla	fronte si fa più pronunciata e	aumenta il blu della loro livrea.	Il pesce napoleone è lungo oltre	1,5 m e si muove molto agilmente	nelle acque tropicali.	Si tratta di un pesce molto raro	e interessante. È sempre	una bella sorpresa avvistarlo.
"049"	Il leone zebrato possiede bellissime	e lunghe pinne che si muovono	elegantemente mentre nuota.	Ma l'aspetto non deve ingannare:	queste pinne possiedono delle	punte velenose.	Il veleno serve a proteggersi contro	i predatori, ma è utile anche nelle	lotte territoriali tra maschi.	Questo veleno è in grado	di uccidere l'esemplare che ha perso	il confronto nel giro di pochi giorni.
"050"	Nonostante sia molto velenoso,	il pesce palla giapponese viene	considerato una vera prelibatezza.	Alla nascita, non è velenoso;	pertanto mangiare gli esemplari	giovani è relativamente sicuro.	Diventano velenosi solo una volta	che hanno ingerito abbastanza	microbi dal cibo e dal mare.	Quando si sentono minacciati,	aspirano aria e acqua fino	a gonfiarsi come un palloncino.	Questo li rende troppo grandi	per essere mangiati senza	addentare i loro aculei velenosi.
"051"	Il pesce palla è coperto di spine.	Al contrario del pesce palla	giapponese, non è velenoso.	Secondo alcune stime esagerate	possiederebbe 1000 spine; in realtà	non supera le 300-400.	Per spaventare i nemici, aspira	aria e acqua per gonfiarsi e	diventare più grosso.
"052"	Lo sgombro ha un sapore molto	gradevole e per molto tempo è	stato un cibo diffuso ed economico.	Eppure, in certe zone del mondo,	ora viene considerato un pesce	molto pregiato e un cibo di lusso.	Entrambi i lati del corpo sono	coperti da squame resistenti che	vanno tolte prima di cucinarlo.	Anche se è piccolo, è un carnivoro	vorace. Il suo istinto predatore	lo rende facile da pescare.
"053"	L'ishidai si distingue per	le sette strisce che adornano	la sua bianca livrea.	Essendo forte e di natura curiosa,	è ambito dai pescatori, anche	se non è facile prenderlo.	Possiede denti molto resistenti che	gli permettono di aprire i gusci	di certe creature marine.	Ad esempio, è in grado di	nutrirsi sia di ricci di mare	che di molluschi.
"054"	La spigola è il pesce più grosso della	famiglia dei Moronidae ed è molto	apprezzata per la sua bianca carne.	Se mangia qualcosa di non	commestibile, apre la bocca e le	branchie e agita la testa con forza.	Può essere uno spettacolo bizzarro,	ma, in questo modo, solitamente	riesce a espellere il corpo estraneo.	Come i suoi cugini di acqua dolce,	la spigola è in grado di tirare con	forza ed è difficile pescarla.
"055"	La colisa è un pesce molto amato	che viene cucinato in tutto il mondo,	anche dove non viene pescato.	Può essere difficile da trovare e	in commercio si possono trovare	specie simili sotto lo stesso nome.	Negli Stati Uniti la colisa	rappresenta il 50% di tutto	il pesce pescato in un anno.	È un pesce molto forte e longevo:	l'esemplare più vecchio mai	registrato ha raggiunto i 57 anni.
"056"	Normalmente la platessa	ha entrambi gli occhi sul lato	destro, anche se ci sono eccezioni.	Alla nascita, gli occhi delle	platesse sono situati su lati	diversi del corpo.	Durante lo sviluppo, l'occhio che	si trova sul lato sinistro si sposta	sul lato destro o viceversa.	Scavano un nascondiglio nella	sabbia del fondale per nascondersi	lasciando fuori gli occhi.	Hanno la bocca piccola e i denti	corti e poco appuntiti. Infatti, si	nutrono di insetti e piccoli animali.
"057"	La sogliola è un pesce di colore	bianco che presenta entrambi	gli occhi sul lato destro.	Alla nascita, la sogliola ha gli occhi	su lati diversi del corpo. Crescendo,	l'occhio sinistro si sposta a destra.	È un pesce carnivoro in grado di	cambiare colore per camuffarsi	sul fondale marino.	Spesso viene confusa	con un suo parente: la platessa.
"058"	Si pensa ai tentacoli del calamaro	come se fossero le sue gambe,	ma in effetti sono le sue braccia.	Sono in tutto dieci tentacoli.	Due di questi vengono usati	per afferrare le prede.	Per nuotare, muovono le loro	pinne ed espellono acqua	da una cavità del corpo.	Se si sentono in pericolo,	emettono inchiostro per	confondere il predatore.
"059"	Le murene di solito vengono	avvistate mentre fanno spuntare	la testa tra le rocce.	Quando una preda ignara	si avvicina, scattano fuori per	afferrarla con i loro denti aguzzi.	Quando una murena morde	qualcosa, è molto difficile	che lasci la presa.	Hanno un corpo lungo e senza pinne.	La loro pelle è simile a quella dei	serpenti e viene usata in pelletteria.
"060"	Le murene a nastro presentano	delle escrescenze a forma di	fiore che escono dal loro naso.	Hanno un colore chiaro e brillante	e prendono il loro nome dalla forma	lunga e sottile del loro corpo.	Alla nascita non hanno sesso, dopo	di che, prima diventano maschi e,	crescendo, diventano femmine.	Spuntano spesso dalla sabbia e	spalancano la bocca, ma questo	non è un segno di rabbia.	Stanno semplicemente respirando.	Nonostante le apparenze, sono	creature molto pacifiche.
"061"	Il pesce abissale vive nel mare	a profondità talmente elevate	che non vede mai la luce.	La sua lanterna emette luce grazie	a dei batteri speciali e viene usata	per attirare le prede.	Quando la preda si avvicina,	il pesce abissale emette un fluido	luminoso per accecarla e afferrarla.	Solo le femmine possiedono	questa utile lanterna e possono	crescere fino a circa 60 cm.	I maschi invece sono più piccoli	e raggiungono solo pochi	centimetri di lunghezza.
"062"	Il tonno può raggiungere circa	3 m di lunghezza e 400 kg di peso.	Sono misure elevate per un pesce.	Considerate queste dimensioni e il	suo ottimo sapore, si tratta di una	preda molto ambita per i pescatori.	Il tonno non può respirare quando	non nuota. Per questo è costretto	a essere sempre in movimento.	Per dormire, non fa altro che	rallentare. La capacità di nuotare	dormendo è davvero molto utile.	È anche un pesce molto veloce,	in grado di sbattere le pinne	fino a raggiungere gli 80 km/h.
"063"	Il marlin blu si riconosce per il suo	naso lungo, simile a quello che	contraddistingue il pescespada.	Il naso viene usato per colpire	le prede anziché per infilzarle	come si potrebbe credere.	È in grado di raggiungere la velocità	di 100 km/h. Riuscire a prenderlo	è una vera sfida per i pescatori.
"064"	Dalle dimensioni non si direbbe,	ma il carango gigante è in realtà	una varietà di sgombro gigante.	Se lo sgombro è snello	e sottile, il carango gigante	ha un grande corpo argentato.	Non è in grado di tollerare	il freddo, pertanto vive in	zone dal clima assai caldo.	Un suo morso ha la capacità	di staccare un dito a un uomo,	quindi occorre fare attenzione.
"065"	Le razze nuotano muovendo	le loro grandi pinne dando quasi	l'impressione che stiano volando.	Se viste dal basso, la loro bocca	può sembrare arricciata in una	sorta di strano sorriso.	Alcune varietà possiedono una punta	alla base della pinna caudale il cui	veleno può essere fatale per l'uomo.	Questo, unito alla loro capacità di	nascondersi nella sabbia sul fondo	del mare, le rende molto pericolose.
"066"	Il pesce luna è una varietà	di pesce palla. Può arrivare	a pesare anche due tonnellate.	Stranamente, non possiede alcuna	pinna caudale e pertanto non è	in grado di nuotare velocemente.	È in grado di deporre più uova	di qualsiasi creatura al mondo:	300 milioni di uova.	Eppure, solamente uno o due	esemplari di quei 300 milioni	riuscirà a sopravvivere.	A volte il pesce luna si dirige	in superficie e galleggia in	vicinanza del pelo dell'acqua.	In questo modo, quando viene	avvistato, sembra quasi che	stia prendendo il sole.
"067"	Come si intuisce dal nome,	questo squalo è caratterizzato	dalla testa a forma di martello.	Contrariamente alle aspettative,	trattandosi di uno squalo, si	tratta di un animale molto mite.	Ha gli occhi alle due estremità del	"martello" e per questo riesce a	vedere in quasi tutte le direzioni.	Stranamente, le sue narici	sono situate molto vicino	ai suoi occhi.	Possiede una serie di piccoli	buchi sulla fronte e sulla	parte inferiore della testa.	Questi gli permettono di percepire	la posizione di pesci anche quando	sono nascosti alla vista.	Si nutre di diversi tipi	di pesce, ma il suo cibo	preferito è la razza.
"068"	Nel passato lo squalo possedeva	delle squame che si sono evolute nei	suoi caratteristici denti triangolari.	Quando uno dei suoi denti si rompe,	si stacca velocemente e al suo	posto ne cresce un altro.	Lo squalo è in grado di percepire	la presenza di sangue da chilometri	di distanza.	Inoltre, può effettuare grandi	salti fuori dall'acqua per	afferrare la sua preda.	Le sue ossa sono interamente	cartilaginee e vengono usate	nell'industria alimentare.
"069"	Lo squalo sega si chiama così per	l'aspetto della sua lunga testa	munita di denti appuntiti.	Per cercare le prede, si appoggia	al fondale marino e utilizza dei	sensori posti sotto la bocca.	A volte agita la testa in mezzo a	un banco di pesci e cattura i pesci	che rimangono impigliati nei denti.
"070"	Lo squalo balena è il pesce più	grande del mondo. È di natura	molto timida e gentile.	Nonostante le grandi dimensioni,	è in grado di nuotare solo	a circa 5 km/h.	Nuota con la bocca aperta per	ingurgitare grandi quantità di	piccole creature con l'acqua marina.	Espelle l'acqua attraverso	le branchie e si nutre	di quello che resta.	Anche se possiede 10.000 denti	disposti su più file, questi non	gli servono per mordere le prede.
"071"	Il pesce remo ha un corpo argenteo	lungo e sottile con una rossa pinna	dorsale. Vive a grandi profondità.	Questo pesce ha un aspetto	impressionante e può raggiungere	e superare i 9 m di lunghezza.	È in grado di nuotare sia torcendo	il proprio corpo che assumendo	una posizione verticale.	La sua bocca è relativamente	piccola in proporzione al resto	del corpo e non possiede denti.	La sua cresta rossa viene spesso	scambiata per capelli e così alcuni	pensano si tratti di una sirena.
"072"	Il celacanto è un pesce antico	ritenuto estinto prima che fosse	ritrovato in Sudafrica.	È un fossile vivente che è cambiato	pochissimo nel corso di ben 400	milioni di anni.	Può superare i 60 anni di vita e	1,80 m di lunghezza, ma è dotato	di un cervello relativamente piccolo.	È anche molto resistente e possiede	più pinne e squame più dure della	media per un pesce.	Ha un sapore molto diverso dagli	altri pesci e contiene un tipo di	grasso indigeribile per l'uomo.	Per questa ragione, è	assolutamente sconsigliato	utilizzarlo per nutrirsi.

"001"	Diese Fische sind so klein,	dass ihr gesamter Körper in	einer Handfläche Platz hat.	Während der Laichzeit färbt sich	der Bauch der Männchen orange, um	mögliche Partnerinnen anzulocken.	Bitterlinge leben in Flüssen	und Seen und legen ihre Eier	in großen Muscheln ab.
"002"	Döbel sind Karpfenfische, die gut an	ihren langen Bauchflossen und dem	vorstehenden Maul zu erkennen sind.	Mithilfe ihrer guten Sprungfähig-	keiten schnappen sie gerne nach	Insekten an der Wasseroberfläche.	Während der Laichzeit färbt sich	die Bauchseite des Männchens rosa	und seine Rückseite blau.
"003"	Karauschen sind für Anfänger relativ	einfach zu fangen, jedoch auch bei	erfahrenen Anglern sehr beliebt.	Sie werden bis zu 15 Jahre alt	und werden wie Koi-Karpfen	gerne in Teichen gehalten.	Sie haben nur selten männlichen	Nachwuchs, weshalb es weit mehr	Weibchen als Männchen gibt.	Die Weibchen können sich jedoch	auch mit den Männchen einiger	anderer Fischarten fortpflanzen.
"004"	Hasel können auch in trübem Wasser	überleben und sind aufgrund ihrer	Vielzahl selbst dort gut zu erkennen.	In der Laichzeit bekommen die	Männchen einen orangefarbenen	Streifen auf der Bauchseite.
"005"	Barben sind mit Karpfen verwandt,	sind jedoch in der Regel länger und	schlanker als diese.	Ein weiteres Unterscheidungs-	merkmal sind die deutlich	kürzeren Barteln.	Trotz ihrer vielen Gräten sind	Barben durchaus essbar, wobei ihr	Geschmack dem der Flunder ähnelt.
"006"	Das charakteristische Merkmal	dieser robusten Fische sind ihre	langen Barteln.	Karpfen sind Allesfresser und	ernähren sich unter anderem von	Würmern und Insektenlarven.	Hinten in ihrem Maul befinden sich	sogenannte Schlundzähne, mit denen	sie Schalentiere knacken können.
"007"	Diese Zierfische sind in der Regel	eher blass, weisen jedoch in vielen	Fällen wunderschöne Muster auf.	Sie sind aus der Karpfenzucht	hervorgegangen, und jeder von ihnen	hat seine individuelle Musterung.	Wegen dieser Einzigartigkeit werden	Koi-Karpfen auch als „schwimmende	Juwelen“ bezeichnet.	Je nach Farbe und Musterung	bezahlen Fischliebhaber teilweise	exorbitante Preise für sie.	Unter idealen Bedingungen	können Koi-Karpfen über	100 Jahre alt werden.
"008"	Goldfische gingen durch selektive	Züchtung aus dem Giebel, einem	Karpfenfisch, hervor.	Es dauerte mehrere Jahrhunderte,	bis sich ihre heutige Farbe und die	lange Schwanzflosse entwickelten.	Auch bunte Goldfische sind als	Jungfische schwarz und weisen	Eigenschaften des Giebels auf.	Mit zunehmendem Alter färben	sie sich rot und nehmen ihr	charakteristisches Äußeres an.
"009"	Die hervorstehenden Augen dieser	Goldfischvariation sind für die	Fische in Wirklichkeit ein Nachteil.	Teleskopaugen sehen sehr schlecht	und übersehen deshalb oft Futter	oder schwimmen gegen Hindernisse.	Die Augen beginnen etwa zwei	Wochen nach dem Schlüpfen	hervorzustehen.
"010"	Diese kleinen Schwarmfische sind	dafür bekannt, dass ihre Augen	relativ weit oben am Kopf sitzen.	Sie halten sich meist in flachen	Gewässern auf und ernähren sich	von Insekten an der Oberfläche.	Um diese Insekten leichter erbeuten	zu können, befindet sich auch ihr	Maul weit oben an ihrem Kopf.	Die Körpertemperatur der Killi-	fische ist ebenso niedrig wie die	des Wassers, in dem sie leben.	Deshalb reagieren sie mitunter	geschockt, wenn man sie mit	warmen Händen berührt.
"011"	Die mit den Garnelen verwandten	Flusskrebse sind in der Regel leicht	zu fangen.	Sie sind Allesfresser und können	deshalb an den unterschiedlichsten	Orten gefunden werden.	Durch pflanzliche Nahrung färben	sie sich rot. Wenn sie nur Fisch und	Fleisch fressen, werden sie blau.	Eine rote Farbe steht also für eine	ausgewogene Ernährung und deutet	auf einen gesunden Flusskrebs hin.
"012"	Weichschildkröten sind zwar eher	friedlich, können bei Gefahr jedoch	durchaus aggressiv werden.	Da sie bei der kleinsten Bewegung	zubeißen, ist es nicht ungefährlich,	sie in den Händen zu halten.	Haben sie sich erst einmal fest-	gebissen, lassen sie erst wieder los,	wenn sie zurück im Wasser sind.	Sie verbringen viel Zeit im Wasser	und sind dank ihrer flachen Panzer	hervorragende Schwimmer.	Weichschildkröten können zwölf	Stunden unter Wasser bleiben, ohne	an der Oberfläche Luft zu holen.
"013"	Kaulquappen sind nichts anderes als	die Larven von Fröschen und leben	in Teichen oder Bächen.	Mit ihren runden Köpfen bewegen	sie sich anfangs noch relativ	unbeholfen.	Später wachsen ihnen Beine, sie	verlieren ihren Schwanz und werden	immer froschähnlicher.	Da sie im Gegensatz zu Fischen	keine Schuppen haben, ist ihre	Haut sehr empfindlich.
"014"	Frösche leben vorzugsweise in der	Nähe von Teichen und anderen	feuchten, sumpfigen Orten.	Sie haben keine Kiemen, sondern	atmen mithilfe von Lungen und	durch die Haut.	Durch Abgabe von Drüsensekret	halten sie ihre Haut schleimig und	schützen sie vor dem Austrocknen.	Ihre Haut wird mit zunehmender	Trockenheit undurchlässiger, was	ihnen die Atmung erschweren kann.	Da einige Froscharten giftig sind,	sollte man immer vorsichtig sein	und sie lieber nicht anfassen.
"015"	Diese kleinen, kräftigen Süßwasser-	fische haben viele schmale Zähne	zum Einsatz gegen ihre Beute.	Flussgrundeln graben Löcher unter	Felsen im Flussbett, um dort Nester	zu bauen und ihre Eier abzulegen.	Da die Nester von den Männchen	bewacht werden, legen auch andere	Fische oft ihre Eier darin ab.
"016"	Bachschmerlen sind relativ kleine	Fische, die in Flüssen und trüben	Gewässern leben.	Die an ihrem Maul befindlichen	Barteln sind mit Geschmacks-	knospen ausgestattet.	Bachschmerlen haben die seltene	Fähigkeit, sowohl über Kiemen als	auch über den Darm zu atmen.	Dabei atmen sie über der Wasser-	oberfläche durch das Maul ein und	durch den Hinterleib wieder aus.	Ein Eintopf aus Bachschmerle,	Klettenwurzel und Eiern stärkt	angeblich die Abwehrkräfte.
"017"	Der Katzenwels ist für seine langen	Barteln, seinen breiten Körper und	sein großes Maul bekannt.	Trotz der großen Augen sieht er	relativ schlecht, kompensiert dies	jedoch durch seine Barteln.	Die kleinen horizontalen und	vertikalen Linien auf seinem Körper	ähneln einer Perforation.	Er nimmt elektrische Impulse	anderer Fische wahr, was ihn zu	einem effektiven Jäger macht.
"018"	Aale kommen im Meer zur Welt und	schwimmen später stromaufwärts	durch Flüsse.	Ein Mal in ihrem Leben kehren sie	allerdings ins Meer zurück, um dort	ihre Eier abzulegen.	Ihr Blut ist in manchen Fällen giftig,	weshalb es sehr gefährlich ist, sie	roh zu essen.	Gekochter Aal ist dagegen ein	sehr beliebtes Gericht und ohne	Probleme essbar.	Die Laichgebiete sowie das	Laichverhalten der Aale waren	lange Zeit ein großes Rätsel.	Wissenschaftler sind derzeit jedoch	dabei, diesen Fischen auch ihre	letzten Geheimnisse zu entlocken.
"019"	Der Schlangenkopf verdankt seinen	Namen der Tatsache, dass sein Kopf	aussieht wie der einer Schlange.	Auch Schuppen und Musterung	erinnern an eine Schlange, wodurch	die Ähnlichkeit noch verstärkt wird.	Schlangenköpfe haben scharfe	Zähne, weshalb man seine Finger	von ihrem Maul fernhalten sollte.	Sowohl die Männchen als auch die	Weibchen bewachen die Eier und	kümmern sich um den Nachwuchs.	Sobald sich andere Fische nähern,	vertreiben sie diese, indem sie wild	mit der Schwanzflosse wedeln.
"020"	Zur Verteidigung gegen Feinde	haben Sonnenbarsche eine mit	Stacheln besetzte Rückenflosse.	Im Gegensatz zu anderen Fischen	hat ihr Nachwuchs eine relativ	hohe Überlebensrate.	Nach dem Laichen vertreiben die	Männchen die Weibchen und	bewachen die Eier und Jungfische.
"021"	Der Flussbarsch hat eine stachelige	Rückenflosse und graue Streifen auf	seinem blassgelben Körper.	In Kanada und den USA ist er ein	beliebter Fang für Eisfischer, die	ihn aus zugefrorenen Seen angeln.
"022"	Barsche verstecken sich oft, um	Beute, die sich ihnen nähert, aus	dem Hinterhalt anzugreifen.	Unter anderen Fischen sind sie	gefürchtet, da die Männchen ihren	Nachwuchs unerbittlich verteidigen.	Obwohl seine Haut einen strengen	Geruch hat, ist der Barsch ein	beliebter Speisefisch.
"023"	Da Hechte in warmem Wasser nicht	überleben können, findet man sie	nur in relativ kühlen Gewässern.	Mit einer Länge von teilweise mehr	als einem Meter sind sie bei Anglern	sehr begehrt.	Ihr großes Maul und ihre scharfen	Zähne machen sie zu gefährlichen	Raubfischen.	Zu ihren Beutetieren gehören nicht	nur andere Fischarten, sondern auch	Vögel und kleine Säugetiere.
"024"	Stinte sind kleine, lebhafte Fische,	die auch in Gewässern mit niedriger	Wasserqualität überleben können.	Sie sind mit den Lachsen verwandt	und haben die gleichen Wanderwege	wie diese.	Die meisten von ihnen schwimmen	von Flüssen ins Meer und kehren	später ins Süßwasser zurück.	Dies gilt jedoch nicht für alle Stinte,	da einige in Seen ohne Verbindung	zum Meer leben.	Mit ihren kleinen Flossen eignen	sie sich gut für Tempura oder	als Grillfisch.
"025"	Ayu-Fische sind Wanderfische, die	in Flüssen zur Welt kommen und	zum Laichen dorthin zurückkehren.	Ähnlich wie die Lachse leben sie	in der Zwischenzeit weitestgehend	im Meer.	Erwachsene Ayu-Fische haben einen	moosigen Geruch, da sie Algen	von Steinen im Flussbett fressen.	Sie verteidigen ihr Revier vehement	gegen Artgenossen, die dort	einzudringen versuchen.	Angler machen sich diese Angriffs-	lust zunutze, indem sie andere	Ayu-Fische als Köder benutzen.
"026"	Wie die meisten Lachse haben	auch Masulachse ein gepunktetes	Muster, das der Tarnung dient.	Meistens verbringen sie ihr Leben	in Flüssen, manche von ihnen	wandern jedoch ins Meer ab.	Bei Anglern sind Masulachse wegen	ihrer schönen Körperform und	Musterung sehr begehrt.	Darüber hinaus sehen viele in ihnen	eine willkommene Herausforderung,	da sie nur schwer zu fangen sind.
"027"	Saiblinge sind Lachsfische, die	vorwiegend in Flüssen leben und	nur selten ins Meer abwandern.	Sie bevorzugen kühle, klare	Gewässer wie zum Beispiel	abgeschiedene Gebirgsflüsse.	Da sie sich die meiste Zeit zwischen	Felsen verstecken, sind sie ziemlich	schwierig zu finden.
"028"	Ausgewachsene Regenbogenforellen	haben einen rosa Streifen, der von	den Kiemen bis zum Schwanz reicht.	Eine spezielle Form ist die Stahl-	kopfforelle, die zwischen Süß- und	Salzwasser hin- und herwandert.	Regenbogenforellen sind beliebte	Speisefische, in freier Wildbahn	findet man sie aber nur sehr selten.
"029"	Huchen leben in kalten Flüssen.	Sie können über einen Meter lang	und bis zu 30 kg schwer werden.	Sie erreichen ein Lebensalter von	bis zu 20 Jahren, sind jedoch erst	nach 15 Jahren ausgewachsen.	Es gibt nur sehr wenige Huchen,	wobei ausgewachsene Exemplare	besonders schwierig zu finden sind.
"030"	Lachse kommen in Flüssen zur Welt,	wandern dann ins Meer und bleiben	dort etwa vier Jahre lang.	In seltenen Fällen kehren sie bereits	nach ein oder zwei Jahren in die	Flüsse zurück.	Durch die Ernährung von Garnelen	und Krill erhält ihr Fleisch die	charakteristische rosa Farbe.	Würden Lachse andere Nahrung zu	sich nehmen, wäre ihr Fleisch weiß.
"031"	Königslachse werden etwa doppelt	so groß wie gewöhnliche Lachse,	wodurch sich ihr Name erklärt.	In manchen Regionen kehren sie im	Frühling oder Sommer in den Fluss	zurück und bleiben bis zum Herbst.	In seltenen Fällen ist das Fleisch	eines Königslachses weiß und nicht	wie gewöhnlich lachsfarben.
"032"	Da diese Krabbenart in China	beheimatet ist, nennt man sie auch	„Chinesische Wollhandkrabbe“.	Bekannt geworden ist sie vor	allem durch ihre Verwendung in	chinesischen Gerichten.	Wollhandkrabben schlüpfen im Meer,	leben in Flüssen und kehren zur	Fortpflanzung ins Meer zurück.	Ihr Lebenszyklus ist damit dem der	Lachse genau entgegengesetzt.
"033"	Guppys sind mit den Killifischen	verwandt und leben in warmen,	tropischen Flüssen.	Ihre schön geschwungene	Schwanzflosse macht sie	zu beliebten Zierfischen.	Die Mutterfische gebären ihre	Jungen, nachdem sie die Eier in	ihrem Bauch ausgebrütet haben.	Dank der konstanten Fortpflanzung	der Guppys wächst ihre Population	sehr schnell.
"034"	Doktorfische sind auch als	„Rötliche Saugbarben“ oder	„Garra rufa“ bekannt.	Sie ernähren sich von Algen und	den oberen Hautschichten anderer	Fische.	Um sie mit abgestorbenen Haut-	zellen zu füttern, braucht man nur	seine Hand ins Wasser zu halten.	Da Doktorfische keine Zähne	haben, schälen sie die toten	Hautpartikel schmerzfrei ab.
"035"	Diese tropischen Fische bewegen	sich dank ihrer langen Rücken- und	Bauchflossen sehr elegant.	Männchen und Weibchen sind	bei den Skalaren nur sehr	schwer auseinanderzuhalten.	Beide Geschlechter beschützen den	Nachwuchs, der sich an Wasser-	pflanzen klammert, gleichermaßen.	Sobald sie ihre charakteristischen 	Flossen entwickelt haben, sind die	Jungfische als Skalare zu erkennen.
"036"	Neonsalmler verdanken ihren Namen	dem metallisch blauen Streifen	quer über ihren Körper.	Interessanterweise sind diese sehr	friedlichen, zurückhaltenden Fische	entfernte Verwandte der Piranhas.	Neonsalmler sind sehr empfindlich	und reagieren sensibel auf die	Wasserqualität und -temperatur.
"037"	Ihren furchteinflößenden Ruf haben	Piranhas vor allem ihren messer-	scharfen Zähnen zu verdanken.	Interessanterweise sind sie zwar	durchaus sehr gefährlich, in der	Regel aber eher zurückhaltend.	Finden sie jedoch keine andere	Nahrung, machen sie nicht einmal	vor ihren Artgenossen Halt.	Zur Sicherheit sollte man auf jeden	Fall versuchen, sich von ihren	Zähnen fernzuhalten.
"038"	Arowanas sind Fische, die seit	100 Millionen Jahren nahezu	unverändert geblieben sind.	Ihre Erkennungsmerkmale sind die	großen Schuppen und das hervor-	stehende Haar an der Unterlippe.	Ihre bemerkenswerte Sprungkraft	erlaubt ihnen Sprünge aus dem	Wasser von über einem Meter Höhe.	Die Männchen bewahren die Jung-	fische bis zu einer gewissen Größe	zum Schutz in ihrem Maul auf.
"039"	Goldmakrelen sind, wie der	Name erraten lässt, golden	schimmernde Fische.	Sie ähneln zwar den Lachsen, ihre	Angriffslust lässt sich jedoch eher	mit der von Piranhas vergleichen.	Ihre Kraft und Unerbittlichkeit	machen die Goldmakrele zu einer	Herausforderung für jeden Angler.
"040"	Knochenhechte werden bis zu	3 Meter lang und erinnern mit	ihren großen Mäulern an Alligatoren.	Diese Fische existieren bereits	seit Millionen von Jahren in ihrer	heutigen Form.	Sie atmen nicht nur durch ihre	Kiemen, sondern auch, indem sie	ihr Maul über Wasser halten.	Die Eier von Knochenhechten sollte	man auf keinen Fall essen – sie sind	nämlich giftig.
"041"	Mit einer Länge von mehr als	2 Metern ist der Arapaima der	größte Süßwasserfisch der Welt.	Es handelt sich um einen echten	Urzeitriesen, der bereits seit über	100 Millionen Jahren existiert.	Er atmet nicht nur durch Kiemen,	sondern muss auch ab und zu auf-	tauchen und nach Luft schnappen.	Mithilfe seiner harten, knochigen	Zunge kann der Arapaima auch	sehr zähe Nahrung zerkleinern.
"042"	Flösselhechte sind Fische, deren	Merkmal ihre stacheligen	Rückenflossen sind.	Obwohl sie seit über 400 Millionen	Jahren existieren, haben sie sich	bis heute kaum verändert.	Ihren enormen Nahrungsbedarf	decken sie mit allen erdenklichen	Fischarten.	Ihr behäbiger Schwimmstil lässt	mitunter an die Laufbewegungen	einiger Dinosaurier denken.
"043"	Wie Eisschollen lassen sich	See-Engel im kalten Wasser	von der Strömung treiben.	Mithilfe ihrer 6 Tentakel	greifen sie nach ihrer	bemitleidenswerten Beute.	See-Engel kommen meist in kalten	Meeren vor, einige Arten jedoch	auch in tropischen Gewässern.
"044"	Auch wenn sie nicht so aussehen,	gehören Seepferdchen aus wissen-	schaftlicher Sicht zu den Fischen.	Mit ihren kleinen Rücken- und	Schwanzflossen sind sie keine	besonders guten Schwimmer.	Sie klammern sich an Seegras oder	Korallen, um nicht von der Strömung	davongetrieben zu werden.	Dabei ernähren sie sich von	vorbeischwebendem Plankton	und kleinen Garnelen.	Die Weibchen platzieren die Eier in	der Brusttasche der Männchen und	überlassen diesen die Brutpflege.
"045"	Anemonenfische sind die einzigen	Fische, die zwischen den Tentakeln	von Seeanemonen leben können.	Sie produzieren eine spezielle	Schutzflüssigkeit, die sie vor dem	Gift der Seeanemone schützt.	So finden die Fische in dieser	giftigen Umgebung Schutz vor	Raubfischen.	Im Gegenzug verteidigen sie die	Seeanemone gegen Parasiten	und Fressfeinde.	Jeder Anemonenfisch kommt als	Männchen zur Welt und kann später	bei Bedarf das Geschlecht wechseln.
"046"	Diese strahlend blauen Tropenfische	erkennt man an ihrer dreieckigen,	gelben Schwanzflosse.	Paletten-Doktorfische sind in	ihrem Verhalten eher schüchtern	und zurückhaltend.	Um im Schlaf geschützt zu sein,	suchen sie sich Lücken zwischen	Korallen oder Felsen aus.
"047"	Falterfische sind aufgrund ihrer	Schönheit beliebte Zierfische.{0000-0004-0000}
"048"	Napoleonfische beginnen ihr Leben	als Weibchen, wechseln jedoch im	höheren Alter ihr Geschlecht.	Blaue Färbung weist darauf hin,	dass es sich um einen älteren Fisch	und somit um ein Männchen handelt.	Ihre massigen Körper werden über	2 Meter lang und gleiten dennoch	elegant durch tropische Gewässer.	Eine Begegnung mit einem	Napoleonfisch ist für jeden Taucher	ein unvergessliches Erlebnis.
"049"	Rotfeuerfische verfügen über	wunderschöne, lange Flossen, die	ein wenig an Schleier erinnern.	Hinter der Schönheit dieser	Flossen verbergen sich jedoch	giftige Stacheln.	Ihr Gift setzen die Fische nicht nur	zur Verteidigung, sondern auch in	Revierkämpfen untereinander ein.	Dabei geht es um Leben und Tod,	denn ein gestochenes Männchen er-	liegt nach wenigen Tagen dem Gift.
"050"	Obwohl sie hochgradig giftig sind,	gelten Kugelfische als wahre	Delikatesse.	Ihr Gift entwickeln sie, sobald sie	über Meerwasser und Nahrung genü-	gend Mikroben aufgenommen haben.	Wenn sie sich bedroht fühlen, saugen	sie Luft und Wasser ein und blasen	sich damit auf wie Ballons.	In dieser Kugelform sind sie	zu groß, um von Raubfischen	verschlungen zu werden.
"051"	Obwohl sie mit den Kugelfischen	verwandt sind, sind die mit Stacheln	bedeckten Igelfische nicht giftig.	Oft wird behauptet, sie hätten über	1 000 Stacheln, tatsächlich sind es	allerdings „nur“ 300 bis 400.	Bei Gefahr pumpen sie sich mit	Wasser und Luft auf, um ihre	Feinde einzuschüchtern.
"052"	Wegen ihres guten Geschmacks	ist die Makrele ein beliebter und	relativ günstiger Speisefisch.	In manchen Teilen der Welt gilt	sie jedoch als Delikatesse, die nur	reicheren Leuten vorbehalten ist.	Die harten Schuppen auf beiden	Seiten des Körpers müssen vor	der Zubereitung entfernt werden.	Makrelen sind Raubfische und	bei Anglern sehr beliebt, da sie	leicht zu ködern sind.
"053"	Zebrabuntbarsche sind leicht an	den 7 Streifen zu erkennen, die	ihre weißen Körper schmücken.	Ihre Neugier macht sie beliebt bei	Anglern, sie sind allerdings sehr	kräftig und nicht leicht zu fangen.	Ihre starken Zähne machen selbst	mit gepanzerten Meerestieren	kurzen Prozess.
"054"	Seebarsche sind bekannt für ihre	teilweise enorme Größe und ihr	schmackhaftes weißes Fleisch.	Wenn sie etwas Unverdauliches	verschlucken, öffnen sie Maul und	Kiemen und schütteln ihren Kopf.	Dieses wilde Schütteln sieht sehr	eigenwillig aus, erfüllt jedoch in	den meisten Fällen seinen Zweck.	Mit ihren kräftigen Bewegungen	sind sie eine echte Herausforderung	für jeden Angler.
"055"	Kaiserschnapperschwärme finden	sich meist in der Nähe von Riffen	oder Schiffswracks.	Der Kaiserschnapper ist ein ausge-	zeichneter Speisefisch und kann	zum Teil über 50 Jahre alt werden.
"056"	Bis auf wenige Ausnahmen befinden	sich bei Klieschen beide Augen auf	der rechten Körperhälfte.	Das linke Auge wandert im Laufe	ihrer Entwicklung nach rechts, was	jedoch nicht immer der Fall ist.	Während ihr restlicher Körper im	Sand vergraben ist, halten sie mit	ihren Augen Ausschau nach Gefahr.	Ihr Maul ist sehr klein, da sie sich	hauptsächlich von Würmern und	anderen Kleinlebewesen ernähren.
"057"	Die meisten Flundern haben beide	Augen auf der rechten Körperhälfte,	bei manchen sind sie jedoch links.	Die Flunder ist mit der Kliesche	verwandt und wird oft mit dieser	verwechselt.	Sie kann ihre Farbe wechseln und	so getarnt am Meeresgrund ihrer	ahnungslosen Beute auflauern.
"058"	Kalmare verwenden zwei ihrer	insgesamt zehn Arme dazu, nach	ihrer Beute zu greifen.	Sie pressen Wasser aus ihrem	Körper und bewegen sich durch	die Rückstoßwirkung fort.	Bei Gefahr geben sie Tinte ab, die	zur Verwirrung von Feinden dient	und ihnen so zur Flucht verhilft.
"059"	Muränen sind oft in Lauerstellung,	wobei sie ihren Kopf gern zwischen	zwei Felsen hervorstrecken.	Sobald sich ihre ahnungslose Beute	nähert, schnappen sie sie mit ihren	messerscharfen Zähnen.	Ihre langen, flossenlosen Körper sind	mit einer zähen Haut bedeckt, die	oft zu Leder verarbeitet wird.
"060"	Nasenmuränen haben langgezogene	Körper und sehen aus, als würden	Blumen aus ihrer Nase sprießen.	Sie schlüpfen geschlechtslos,	entwickeln sich dann zu Männchen	und später zu Weibchen.	Wenn sie ihr Maul weit geöffnet aus	dem Sand strecken, ist das keines-	wegs als Angriffslust zu verstehen.	In Wirklichkeit holen sie nur Luft.	Trotz ihres furchteinflößenden	Äußeren sind sie relativ friedlich.
"061"	Anglerfische leben so weit unter der	Meeresoberfläche, dass das Sonnen-	licht sie nicht erreichen kann.	Weibliche Anglerfische werden bis	zu zehnmal so groß wie ihre	männlichen Artgenossen.	Nur sie verfügen über die charak-	teristischen Laternen, die sie für	die Suche nach Beute verwenden.	Wenn sie ein Beutetier erblicken,	blenden sie es durch Absondern	einer leuchtenden Flüssigkeit.
"062"	Mit einer Länge von teilweise mehr	als 3 Metern gehören Thunfische	zu den Riesen unter den Fischen.	Da sie außerdem beliebte Speise-	fische sind, stellen sie für Angler	stets einen willkommenen Fang dar.	Ihre Rastlosigkeit erklärt sich	dadurch, dass sie nur atmen können,	solange sie in Bewegung bleiben.	Mit ihren zwei kräftigen Flossen-	paaren erreichen sie Geschwindig-	keiten von bis zu 80 km/h.	Sogar im Schlaf schwimmen	Thunfische weiter, wenn auch	etwas langsamer.
"063"	Marline sind berühmt für ihre	langen, spitzen Nasen und werden	auch „Speerfische“ genannt.	Anstatt ihre Beute mit dem „Speer“	aufzuspießen, schlagen sie sie damit	bewusstlos, bevor sie zuschnappen.	Mit Geschwindigkeiten von über	100 km/h sind diese Kraftpakete ein	echter Härtetest für jeden Angler.
"064"	Pferdemakrelen unterscheiden sich	durch ihre enorme Größe maß-	geblich von gewöhnlichen Makrelen.	Im Gegensatz zu den schlanken,	geschmeidigen Makrelen haben sie	einen massigen silbernen Körper.	Da sie keine Kälte vertragen, findet	man sie ausschließlich in wärmeren	Regionen der Erde.	Ihre gewaltigen Kiefer verfügen	über genügend Kraft, um einen	menschlichen Finger abzubeißen.
"065"	Wenn Rochen mit ihren großen	Flossen schlagen, wirkt es fast	so, als würden sie fliegen.	Von unten sehen sie aus, als	hätten sie ihre Mäuler zu einer	Art Lächeln verzogen.	Manche Rochen haben Giftstacheln	auf der Unterseite ihres Schwanzes,	die für Menschen tödlich sind.	Das macht sie sehr gefährlich, zumal	sie sich gerne am Meeresboden im	Sand verstecken.
"066"	Mondfische sind Verwandte der	Kugelfische und können bis zu	2 Tonnen auf die Waage bringen.	Da sie keine Schwanzflosse haben,	können sie nicht besonders schnell	schwimmen.	Die Weibchen legen bis zu	300 Millionen Eier und damit mehr	als jede anderen Fischart.	Aus diesen 300 Millionen Eiern	gehen am Ende jedoch nur ein oder	zwei überlebende Fische hervor.	Manchmal kann man Mondfische	sehen, die sich an der Meeres-	oberfläche auf und ab bewegen.
"067"	Obwohl sie zu den Haien gehören,	sind Hammerhaie interessanterweise	eher friedliche Fische.	Da ihre Augen an beiden Enden des	hammerförmigen Kopfes sitzen,	haben sie ein sehr weites Blickfeld.	Ihre Nasenlöcher sitzen	jeweils auf der Innenseite	neben den Augen.	Auf der Vorderseite und im unteren	Bereich des Kopfes haben Hammer-	haie weitere kleine Öffnungen.	Diese erlauben es ihnen, Beute	aufzuspüren, die sich außerhalb	ihrer Sicht befindet.	Von den vielen Fischarten, von	denen sie sich ernähren, sind	Rochen ihre Leibspeise.
"068"	Die dreieckigen Zähne von Haien	haben sich vermutlich irgendwann	aus Schuppen entwickelt.	Wird ein Zahn beschädigt, so fällt er	kurze Zeit später aus und ein neuer	Zahn wächst an seiner Stelle nach.	Haie haben die beängstigende	Fähigkeit, Blut über mehrere	Kilometer zu riechen.	Sie sind gefürchtete Jäger und	können sogar aus dem Wasser	springen, um Beute zu schnappen.	Ihr Skelett besteht aus Knorpel,	wodurch Haie sehr wendig sind	und im Wasser viel Auftrieb haben.
"069"	Der Sägehai verdankt seinen Namen	seinem langen, mit Zähnen besetzten	Kopf, der einer Kettensäge ähnelt.	Am Meeresgrund sucht er nach	seiner Beute, die er mithilfe von	Sensoren unter dem Maul aufspürt.	Mit seiner „Säge“ wütet er ab und	zu in Fischschwärmen und erbeutet	dabei alles, was er verletzt.
"070"	Walhaie sind die größten Fische der	Welt, gehören überraschenderweise	jedoch auch zu den friedlichsten.	Sie erreichen beim Schwimmen nur	5 km/h und sind damit trotz ihrer	Größe keine wirkliche Bedrohung.	Sie schwimmen mit geöffnetem	Maul und verschlucken dabei große	Mengen an Kleintieren und Wasser.	Das Wasser stoßen sie durch die	Kiemen wieder aus und ernähren	sich von dem, was zurückbleibt.	Ihre ca. 10 000 mehrreihigen Zähne	dienen also nicht zum Kauen und	erinnern daher auch eher an Feilen.
"071"	Auf dem langgezogenen, silbernen	Körper der Riemenfische befindet	sich eine rote Rückenflosse.	Sie können über 10 Meter lang	werden, was sie zu riesigen und	bemerkenswerten Fischen macht.	Meist bewegen sie sich fort,	indem sie ihre langen, schmalen	Körper verdrehen.	Ihr Maul ist verhältnismäßig klein,	sodass sie trotz ihrer Größe nicht	besonders furchteinflößend sind.
"072"	Quastenflosser hielt man lange Zeit	für ausgestorben, bis in Südafrika	ein Exemplar entdeckt wurde.	Da sie sich seit 400 Millionen	Jahren kaum verändert haben, nennt	man sie auch „lebende Fossilien“.	Sie können über 60 Jahre alt	werden und ihr Gehirn ist selbst	für Fische ziemlich klein.	Sie haben mehr Flossen und härtere	Schuppen als andere Fische und sind	dadurch sehr widerstandsfähig.	Sie schmecken anders als die	meisten Fische und enthalten ein	für Menschen unverdauliches Fett.	Aus diesem Grund ist der	Quastenflosser nicht als	Speisefisch geeignet.
