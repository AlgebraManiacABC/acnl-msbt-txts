"003"	{emote: Pride}If I seemed familiar the first time	you met me,{pause 16} it's probably because I	used to do a little acting.	{emote: Flourish}Oh, they said I'd see my name in	lights before long, {pause 16}but I gave it up	for the quiet life here in {Town name (pink)}.{Player can respond (0005):0012-0000-0015-0000}	Why?	Good for you.

"011"
"012"	{emote: Worry}Well, after the show aired, {pause 16}I was	recognized everywhere I went. It	was fun at first{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}	{emote: Aggravation}But then it got really annoying! {pause 16}I	couldn't go anywhere without 	signing a cheesy picture of myself.	So{pause 8} I totally reinvented myself.{pause 16} {emote: Showmanship}New	hairstyle and everything.{pause 16} Life's been	grand ever since!	{emote: Glare}Now I just sing in the shower. {pause 16}{emote: Glee}And I	still sound fabulous!

"014"	{emote: Disagreement}Well, you can't dance flamenco	without any flamenco music,{pause 8}	{Player nickname (green)}.	I only perform as part of a trio{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}	I require a qualified singer and	guitarist{pause 8} {emote: Flourish}to showcase my dancing.	{emote: Shyness}If you ever want to see me perform,{pause 8}	{emote: Agreement}please thoroughly review my	200-page contract for details.{000a-0000-0006-0f03-1000-cd00}
"015"	{emote: Soft Smile}Of course, for you{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}I might be	willing to make a small exception.{Wait for input}{emote: Showmanship}Or maybe we could go out dancing	together. {pause 16}We can do the	{000e-0004-0000}{Town name (pink)} Town Slide!
"016"	{emote: Thought}Oh, I don't suppose it would hurt	anything to show you one of my	moves.	{emote: Showmanship}{pause 32}See? {pause 8}I told you I was hot stuff. {pause 8}I'm	probably the best dancer in 	{Town name (pink)},{pause 8} don't you think?
"017"	Yeah, it's a shame.{pause 16}{emote: Anger} {capitalized}{Town name (pink)} just	doesn't have a big enough stage for	me, {catchphrase}.
"018"	Well,{pause 8} I used to think it was fun to	dress up and pretend to be	someone else.	{emote: Sunny}But one day I realized that I'm	happiest just being myself.{000a-0000-0006-1304-1400-cd00}
"019"	{emote: Soft Smile}Especially now that I have so many	good friends in {Town name (pink)}{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8} Like 	you, {Player nickname (green)}!{emote: Glee}	I know it's a little corny, {pause 8}{emote: Love}but you	guys are the best.{pause 16} I'm so happy{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}	I don't think I could even act sad!
"020"	That's why {Town name (pink)} is such a	great place to live.{pause 8} I've connected	with so many cool friends.	{emote: Soft Smile}Of course,{pause 8} you and I aren't quite	BFFs yet,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)},{pause 8} but maybe	we'll get there someday.
"021"	{emote: Sheepishness}Yeah{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}being a celebrity isn't all it's	cracked up to be. {pause 8}Who has the time	to sign autographs,{pause 8} {catchphrase}?
"022"	Of course,{pause 8} it's not an easy game to	learn.{emote: Sheepishness}{pause 16} That's probably why I'm so	good at it.
"023"	{emote: Sheepishness}If you're worried that it will be too	hard to learn how to play{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}you're	probably right.
"024"	{emote: Sheepishness}We should play sometime{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}once you	understand the rules, {pause 16}but before you	get too good!
"025"	{emote: Shocked}Wow,{pause 8} that's impressive!{pause 8} It can be	kind of scary to explore a foreign	land all by yourself.	But it's also a good way to see the	things you want{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{emote: Agreement}without worrying	about anyone else's schedule.{000a-0001-0004-001a-001b}
"026"	{emote: Happiness}I never knew you had so many	interesting stories to tell. {pause 16}We	should talk more! {capitalized}{catchphrase}!
"027"	{emote: Happiness}I think you've inspired me,	{Player nickname (green)}!{pause 16} I feel like I could pack	up right now and travel the world.
"028"	{emote: Sheepishness}Well,{pause 16} that's understandable.{pause 8} It's	easier to travel with your family or	friends.	But I have to say,{pause 8}{emote: Surprise} it can be an	eye-opening experience to visit	new places by yourself.	{emote: Agreement}I think you should try it sometime,	{Player nickname (green)}!{pause 8} You might find you're	more adventurous than you think.
"029"	{emote: Agreement}Yep, there's nothing like opening a	new book for the first time.{pause 8} The	crisp pages, {emote: Love}{pause 8}that new-book smell{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}	But don't forget to reread the	classics every now and then. {pause 8}They	always have something to offer.	{emote: Curious}Are you surprised I'm such a big	reader? You shouldn't be{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8} I'm, like,	the smartest {0005-001f-0002-cd00} in town{emote: Glare}!
"030"	Oh, me too! {emote: Joy}{pause 8}There's nothing better	than curling up with an old favorite	on the couch.	{emote: Agreement}And if it's something you haven't	read in a while, {pause 8}there's so much to	rediscover.	{emote: Inspired}That reminds me—{pause 8}I haven't read	The Saga of the {000e-0004-0000}{Player rumor}	and the {000e-0004-0000}{0005-000f-0002-0000} in ages!
"031"	{emote: Alarmed}What? {pause 16}You don't read at {0007-000a-0000}ALL?{pause 8} Oh,	{Player nickname (green)},{pause 8}{emote: Sadness} that's so disappointing	to hear!	{emote: Anger}Are you sure you don't secretly like	reading? {pause 16}It's OK,{pause 8} you know. I think	reading's cool, {emote: Pride}{pause 16}and I'm {pause 8}the coolest.
"032"	{emote: Soft Smile}That's great! {pause 8}The best time to get	out and see the world is while	you're still young.	See,{pause 8} when you're older,{pause 8} it can be	tough. {pause 8}You get used to a certain	level of comfort.	{emote: Anger}And when kids are partying all night	long in your hostel{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{emote: Aggravation}it just makes	you want to scream!	{0007-000b-0000}I NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP!{pause 16}	{emote: Disbelief}Oh! I mean{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}that could happen. {pause 8}In	theory. {pause 8}I'm sure you'll be fine.
"033"	{emote: Soft Smile}Good for you. Even if you only visit	the next town over,{pause 8} it's always a	rewarding experience.	{emote: Agreement}Of course, the farther away you	travel from {Town name (pink)},{pause 8} the more	exciting things get!	{emote: Inspired}You should try to explore as many	places as you can while you're	young,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}.	Because when you get older, {pause 8}your	priorities change. {pause 8}For example{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{Wait for input}{emote: Sheepishness}I'm here today to eat prunes and	yell at kids to stay off the lawn.{emote: Anger}{pause 32}	And I'm almost out of prunes.
"034"	{emote: Alarmed}Oh, {Player nickname (green)}, you're missing out!	There are so many sights to see,{pause 8}	people to meet, {pause 8}and foods to try!	{emote: Agreement}Trust me, {pause 8}you haven't lived until	you've tried {0005-0010-0002-0000}-	infused {0005-0013-0002-0000}!
"035"	{emote: Anger}Don't even get me started on loud	gum smackers. {pause 8}Or crunchy-chip	chewers!
"036"	{emote: Alarmed}Are you serious? {pause 8}You're one of	those infernal spaghetti slurpers?{pause 16}	{emote: Aggravation}You guys drive me nuts!	{emote: Anger}Let me give you a quick lesson.{pause 8}	First,{pause 8} twirl the spaghetti on your	fork.	Don't twirl up too much at once.{pause 8}	Only twirl an amount you can eat in	one bite.	And{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}I guess that's pretty much it.{pause 8}	{emote: Glare}Hey, I never said it was rocket 	science!
"037"	{emote: Soft Smile}Heh, {pause 8}so you know exactly how I	feel. {pause 8}On days like today, I want to	be a rebel and just buzz it all off.	{emote: Inspired}Then I can throw away my combs	and brushes and products and save	myself an hour each morning.	Ah, {pause 8}but when I have a good hair	day{emote: Joy}{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}it's all worth it, {pause 8}don't you	think?{000a-0001-0004-0026-0027}
"038"	Of course,{pause 8} the style in {Town name (pink)} is	so casual. {pause 8}{emote: Flourish}Everyone's got their own	look,{pause 8} and they rock it!	{emote: Agreement}So it's best not to let a few funky	follicles ruin your day, {pause 8}my little	tantrum notwithstanding!
"039"	{emote: Glare}Of course, it's best not to let a few	funky follicles ruin your day. {pause 8}I just	think of the old saying:	"Good hair{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}bad hair{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{emote: Laughter}I'm the one	with the activator and straight	iron!"
"040"	{emote: Alarmed}Well{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}it's good to be confident! {pause 8}Just	remember,{pause 8} looks aren't everything.{pause 8}	{emote: Agreement}You need smarts to get ahead!
"041"	{emote: Glare}Maybe I shouldn't brag, {pause 8}but I've	been named "Fastest {000e-0004-0000}{0005-001f-0002-cd00} in	{000e-0004-0000}{Town name (pink)}" for 3 years running.
"042"	{emote: Sunny}Let me know if you ever need any	running advice—{pause 8}from one speedy	girl to another. {pause 16}OK, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}?
"043"
"044"
"045"	Brr!{emote: Sigh}{pause 8} It's so cold out!{pause 8} {emote: Fearful}At least we're	getting a little snow to go with	these freezing temperatures.	{emote: Inspired}And you know what that means,	don't you, {Player nickname (green)}?{Wait for input} {emote: Joy}It's time to	make a snowman!	{emote: Disbelief}You don't know how to build one?{pause 8}	Well, it's easy. {pause 8}First, get a snowball,	{pause 8}and roll it around in the snow.	{emote: Agreement}Be careful around the water{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}and	roll up one snowball at a time.{pause 8} When	they're the right size,{pause 8} stack 'em up!	I can't wait to see what kind of	snowman you'll build, {Player nickname (green)}!
"046"	You know what's really fun about	this wild weather,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}? {emote: Sunny}You	can build a snowman!	{emote: Sheepishness}Of course,{pause 8} a snowman is more	than just two snowballs stacked	on top of each other,{pause 8} you know.	{emote: Soft Smile}You can build a baby snowman,{pause 8}	a kid-sized snowman{pause 8}, or even a	giant papa snowman!	{emote: Curious}I wonder what would happen if you	made an entire snowfamily.{pause 8}	{capitalized}{catchphrase}?
"047"
"048"	You know, {pause 8}every time I eat	{0005-0013-0002-0000},{pause 8} I think of my	childhood.	{emote: Love}Nobody makes it like my mom!{pause 16} {emote: Curious}Are	there any foods that make you	nostalgic,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}?{Player can respond (0005):0031-0015-0032-0028}	Of course!	No, not really.
"049"	{emote: Delight}That's so good to hear!{pause 8} It's	important to cherish those fond	memories.	{emote: Thought}So what was your favorite?{pause 8} A	classic like {0005-0013-0002-0000}?{pause 8} Or	a new twist on {0005-0013-0002-0001}?	{emote: Glare}Either way{pause 8}, hang on to that recipe!{pause 8}	It's something you can share with	your own kids when the time comes.
"050"	{emote: Worry}Oh,{pause 8} that's surprising! {pause 8}Taste and	smell usually have a way of	bringing up old memories.	I'd offer to make a traditional	{Town name (pink)} meal for you sometime{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{Wait for input}{emote: Anger}But I'm not your mother! {pause 8}Or your	father,{pause 8} for that matter! {pause 8}Dads can	cook too,{pause 8} you know.
"051"	I've been wondering, {Player nickname (green)}:	Are you really good at	{0005-0011-0002-0100}?{Player can respond (0005):0034-0000-0035-0028}	How did you know?	No, not at all.
"052"	{emote: Sheepishness}Haven't I told you before?{pause 8} I'm a	little bit psychic.{Wait for input}In all seriousness, you just have the	look of someone who has some	experience with {0005-0011-0002-0100}.	{emote: Glare}Take it as a compliment,	{Player nickname (green)}! You seem like a	sporting {fellow/gal}.
"053"	{emote: Sheepishness}Well, you should think about taking	it up.{pause 8}{emote: Glare} I know the uniform would look	good on you.
"054"	So tell me,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}, {pause 8}{emote: Curious}what kind of	clothes do you wear when you're	relaxing at home?{Player can respond (0000):0037-0000-0038-0000}	Whatever's comfy.	I keep it stylish.
"055"	{emote: Agreement}Me too.{pause 8} I just don't feel like putting	on fancy clothes when I'm going to	sit around and eat popcorn.	{emote: Worry}You won't tell anyone, {pause 8}will you? {pause 8}I	have a reputation to maintain!
"056"	{emote: Shocked}Really?{pause 8} Who are you trying to	impress?{Wait for input}{emote: Anger}Don't get me wrong—{pause 8}sweatpants	are not meant to be seen in public.{pause 16}	But they're fine for a lazy day in.
"057"	{000a-0001-0004-003a-003b}
"058"	{emote: Curious}This might seem like a weird	question, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)},{pause 8} but do you	ever wear makeup?{Player can respond (0005):003c-0015-003d-0028}	Yes, once in a while.	No, never.
"059"	{emote: Soft Smile}OK, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}, {pause 8}from one girl to 	another: {pause 8}do you usually wear	makeup?{Player can respond (0005):003e-0015-003f-0028}	Yes, I do.	Not usually.
"060"	{emote: Thought}Well,{pause 8} there's nothing wrong with	that. {pause 16}It's {Year}.{pause 16} Boys are wearing	makeup.{pause 16}{emote: Pride} I say {pause 16}deal with it!	{emote: Laughter}Just don't put too much foundation	and self tanner on,{pause 8} or you'll look like	a news anchor.
"061"	{emote: Agreement}Well, you've got really nice skin and	a good complexion. {pause 8}I'm jealous!{Wait for input}Of course, {pause 8}more and more men are	wearing makeup these days.{pause 8} {emote: Happiness}Nothing	wrong with trying to look good!
"062"	{emote: Agreement}Me too.{pause 8} It's nice to add a little	sparkle or some color when you're	feeling flat.	{emote: Joy}But nothing radiates beauty like a	pretty smile and kind eyes.{pause 8} Don't	you agree, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}?
"063"	{emote: Alarmed}Wow, you look great{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}and so	natural! {pause 8}I'm jealous of your	complexion.	{emote: Mischief}You'll have to share your skin-care	routine with me sometime.{pause 8} OK,{pause 8}	{Player nickname (green)}?

Non è una bella cosa!	{emote: Inspired}Forse ti piace leggere,	solo che non lo sai ancora?	{pause 16}A me piace molto {emote: Pride}{pause 16}e me ne vanto!
"032"	{emote: Soft Smile}Brav{o/a}! {pause 8}Non c'è momento	migliore di quando si è giovani	per vedere il mondo.	Vedi,{pause 8} poi passano gli anni{pause 8} e subentra	la pigrizia. {pause 8}Io ormai non ho più	voglia di muovermi di casa!	{emote: Anger}Soprattutto se nel tuo albergo	alloggia un'intera scolaresca.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{emote: Aggravation}	Ti viene voglia di gridare...	{0007-000b-0000}"C'È GENTE CHE DORME QUI!!!"{pause 16}	{emote: Disbelief}Oh! Scusa.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8} parlavo per sentito	dire. {pause 8}Bello viaggiare.{pause 8} Bellissimo.
"033"	{emote: Soft Smile}Brav{o/a}. L'importante è non rimanere	sempre confinati nella propria città,	{pause 8}anche senza andare lontanissimo!	{emote: Agreement}Ovviamente più ci si allontana da	{Town name (pink)},{pause 8} più i posti sembrano	diversi ed eccitanti!	{emote: Inspired}Dovresti cercare di viaggiare	quanto più possibile finché	sei giovane, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}.	Poi si diventa grandi {pause 8}e le priorità	cambiano. {pause 8}Per esempio,	io oggi avevo in programma di.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}	... mangiare prugne secche	mentre urlo ai bambini	di non calpestare il prato.	{emote: Anger}{pause 8}Ma ora che ci penso,	sono un po' a corto di prugne...
"034"	{emote: Alarmed}Oh, non sai cosa ti perdi! Ci sono	tanti posti da vedere,{pause 8} gente	da conoscere, {pause 8}cibi da assaggiare!	{emote: Agreement}La vita non ha senso se non	provi un po' di {0005-0013-0002-0000}	con contorno di {0005-0010-0002-0000}!
"035"	{emote: Anger}Per non parlare di chi mastica	la gomma a bocca aperta {pause 8}o di chi	sgranocchia patatine in biblioteca!
"036"	{emote: Alarmed}Sul serio? {pause 8}Anche tu fai quel	rumore orrendo con la bocca?{pause 16}	{emote: Aggravation}È una cosa che mi fa imbestialire!	{emote: Anger}Va bene, ti insegno a mangiare	gli spaghetti.{pause 8} Prima di tutto,{pause 8}	arrotolali con la forchetta.

"037"	{emote: Soft Smile}Eh, {pause 8}allora sai come mi sento.	{pause 8}Come vorrei essere ancora giovane	e lasciare i capelli spettinati...	{emote: Shyness}Potrei buttare via tutte le mie	spazzole e i prodotti che uso	e sbrigarmi prima la mattina...	Ma è anche vero che andare	dal parrucchiere{emote: Joy}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8} è una delle gioie	della vita, {pause 8}non credi anche tu?{000a-0001-0004-0026-0027}
"038"	Certo,{pause 8} qui {000e-0010-0000} {Town name (pink)} non ci si	bada molto. {pause 8}{emote: Flourish}Ognuno ha il proprio	stile...{pause 8} e che stile!	{emote: Agreement}Forse è meglio non preoccuparsene	troppo, {pause 8}dopotutto!
"039"	{emote: Glare}Certo, sarebbe anche sciocco	lasciarsi rovinare la giornata	da un paio di doppie punte.	Anche se il proverbio dice:	{pause 8}"Capelli e guai.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}{emote: Laughter} non mancan mai!"

"045"	Brrr!{emote: Sigh}{pause 8} Che freddo che fa!{pause 8}	{emote: Fearful}L'unica cosa positiva è la neve.{Wait for input}{emote: Inspired}Sai perché mi piace tanto,	{Player nickname (green)}?{Wait for input} {emote: Joy}Perché adoro	i pupazzi di neve!	{emote: Disbelief}Non li sai fare?{pause 8} Beh, è facile.	{pause 8}Quando trovi una palla di neve	in città, {pause 8}spingila per farla rotolare.	{emote: Agreement}Tienila lontana dall'acqua.{pause 8}	Quando ne trovi un'altra,{pause 8}	uniscila alla prima. Tutto qua!	Non vedo l'ora di ammirare	il tuo pupazzo, {Player nickname (green)}!
"046"	Sai cosa mi piace di questo periodo	dell'anno, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}? {emote: Sunny}Che si	possono fare i pupazzi di neve!	{emote: Sheepishness}Un pupazzo di neve è molto	più di due grandi palle di neve	messe una sopra l'altra.	{emote: Soft Smile}Si possono creare piccoli pupazzi di	neve a forma di bambino,{pause 8} ragazzo,{pause 8}	o anche pupazzi più grandi!	{emote: Curious}Hai mai provato a creare un'intera	famiglia di neve,{pause 8} {catchphrase}?
"047"
"048"	Sai, {pause 8}ogni volta che mangio	un piatto di {0005-0013-0002-0000},{pause 8}	ripenso alla mia infanzia.	{emote: Love}La cucina della mamma non si	scorda mai!{pause 16} {emote: Curious}Anche tu hai nostalgia	di certi manicaretti,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}?{Player can respond (0005):0031-0015-0032-0028}	Certo!	No, affatto.
"049"	{emote: Delight}Mi fa piacere sentirlo!{pause 8}	Quando vedo tutti quei cibi pronti	al supermercato, mi agito!	{emote: Thought}Qual è il tuo piatto preferito?{pause 8}	Ti piace di più la cucina tradizionale	o a volte sperimenti cose nuove?	{emote: Glare}Se hai per le mani qualcosa	di interessante{pause 8}, passami la ricetta!
"050"	{emote: Worry}Oh, ero convinta di sì!	{pause 8}Molti dei miei ricordi sono	associati a profumi e sapori.

"051"	{capitalized}{Player nickname (green)}, mi stavo giusto	chiedendo... È vero che sei	un{ campione/a campionessa} di {0005-0011-0002-0100}?{Player can respond (0005):0034-0000-0035-0028}	Come fai a saperlo?	No, per niente.
"052"	{emote: Sheepishness}Ah, non te l'avevo detto?{pause 8}	Ho dei poteri paranormali!{Wait for input}Scherzi a parte, hai proprio	l'aria di un{o/a} che se ne intende	di {0005-0011-0002-0100}.	{emote: Glare}È un complimento, {Player nickname (green)}!{pause 15}	Si vede che sei un{o/a} sportiv{o/a} nat{o/a}.

"058"	{emote: Curious}Ti sembrerà una domanda	strana, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)},{pause 8} ma tu	ti sei mai truccat{o/a}?{Player can respond (0005):003c-0015-003d-0028}	Sì, una volta.	No, mai.
"059"	{emote: Soft Smile}Voglio farti una domanda personale,	{pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}: {pause 8}ti trucchi?{Player can respond (0005):003e-0015-003f-0028}	Sì.	Di solito no.
"060"	{emote: Disbelief}Ai miei tempi non era così!{pause 8}	Anzi, non si truccava nessuno:{pause 8}	e chi li aveva i soldi per il trucco...?	{emote: Thought}Se fosse per me, poi, non mi	truccherei neanche adesso:	è una gran seccatura!{Wait for input}Certo,{pause 8} magari ad Halloween...{pause 8}	Ma solo per rendere più efficace	il travestimento,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}!
"061"	{emote: Agreement}Beh, hai la pelle perfetta e un bel	colorito: {pause 8}non ne hai bisogno!{Wait for input}Io, comunque, non avrei niente in	contrario. {pause 8}{emote: Happiness}Se uno vuole migliorare	il suo aspetto, che c'è di male?
"062"	{emote: Agreement}Anch'io.{pause 8} Certe mattine	mi sveglio con una cera...{pause 8}	Meglio correre ai ripari!	{emote: Joy}Ma in fin dei conti, un bel viso	sorridente è più efficace del	miglior trucco.{pause 8} Vero, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}?
"063"	{emote: Alarmed}Uau, avrei giurato di sì.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}	Ma allora sei la classica	bellezza acqua e sapone!	{emote: Mischief}Un giorno di questi dovrai spiegarmi	come fai a tenere la pelle così	morbida.{pause 8} Va bene,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}?

"001"	{emote: Pride}Ist dir bewusst, dass ich einstmals	eine erfolgreiche Vokalistin war,{pause 8}	{Player nickname (green)}?	Ich war sogar im Fernsehen,{pause 16} in der	„Jazzstunde aus {Town name (pink)}“.{Wait for input}Allerdings habe ich das Singen	in der Öffentlichkeit vorerst	aufgegeben.{Player can respond (0005):000c-0000-000d-0000}	Wieso denn?	Das ist schade.
"002"	{emote: Pride}So erstaunlich es klingt, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)},{pause 8}	ich war einst eine begnadete	Flamencotänzerin.	{emote: Worry}Aber ich tanze nicht mehr viel.{pause 30}	Obwohl ich den Rhythmus noch	immer im Blut habe{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 30}{emote: Showmanship} Cha-Cha-{0007-000b-0000}CHA!{Player can respond (0005):000e-0000-0011-0000}	Wieso tanzt du nicht?	Oh, schade.
"003"	{emote: Pride}Wenn ich dir schon immer bekannt	vorkam, so liegt dies sicher daran,	dass ich mal schauspielerte.	{emote: Flourish}Man sagte mir eine grandiose	Karriere voraus, {pause 8}jedoch gab ich	die Schauspielerei wieder auf.	Stattdessen wählte ich ein ruhiges	Leben in {Town name (pink)}.{Player can respond (0005):0012-0000-0015-0000}	Wieso das denn?	Das freut mich für dich!
"004"	{emote: Sheepishness}{capitalized}{Player nickname (green)}!{pause 20} Hast du schon einmal	Schach gespielt?{Wait for input}{emote: Soft Smile}Du denkst vielleicht, das spielen nur	alte Leute, {pause 8}aber in Wirklichkeit ist	es äußerst kurzweilig.{0009-0001-0006-0016-0017-0018}
"005"	{emote: Soft Smile}Bist du schon einmal allein verreist,{pause 8}	{Player nickname (green)}?{Player can respond (0005):0019-0015-001c-0028}	Ja, klar!	Nein, noch nie.
"006"	Wenn du ein gutes Buch suchst,	kann ich dir eines empfehlen:{pause 40}	„{0005-001d-0002-0100}“.	{emote: Love}Die Prosa ist glasklar, die Handlung	durchdacht und überraschend.{pause 20}	Ich lese es immer wieder gern.	{emote: Curious}Hast du auch ein Lieblingsbuch, das	du immer wieder liest?{pause 30} Oder liest	du lieber ständig etwas Neues?{Player can respond (0006):001d-0000-001e-0000-001f-0028}	Lieber etwas Neues.	Lieber gutes Altes.	Lieber gar nicht lesen.
"007"	{emote: Soft Smile}{capitalized}{Town name (pink)} mag ein reizender Ort	sein, {pause 8}aber die Welt ist groß.{pause 20}	Bist du schon einmal verreist?{Player can respond (0006):0020-0000-0021-0000-0022-0028}	Ja, ich verreise oft!	Gelegentlich.	Nein, nie.
"008"	{emote: Anger}Es geht mir gegen den Strich, wenn	jemand seine Spaghetti schlürft.{pause 20}{emote: Aggravation}	Ich könnte jedes Mal ausflippen!	{0007-000a-0000}Pfui! {pause 20}Das treibt mich irgendwann	noch in den Wahnsinn!{Player can respond (0005):0023-0015-0024-0000}	Stimmt, das ist doof!	Hmmm, also...
"009"	{emote: Anger}Argh!{pause 40}{0007-000a-0000} {emote: Aggravation}Meine Haare sind heute	ausgesprochen widerborstig!{pause 20}	Ich kann sie kaum noch bändigen!	{emote: Worry}Dabei habe ich schon alles probiert!{pause 20}	Haarspray, Haargel, Olivenöl{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 20}	Ist dein Haar auch so eigenwillig?{Player can respond (0005):0025-0015-0028-0028}	Leider schon.	Nein, es ist perfekt.
"010"	{emote: Soft Smile}Ich möchte nicht prahlen, {pause 8}{emote: Glare}aber ich	bin äußerst stolz auf meine Beine.{Wait for input}{emote: Alarmed}Nicht wegen ihrer Länge!{pause 20}{emote: Sunny} Es gibt nur	kaum jemanden in {Town name (pink)}, der	schneller rennen kann.	{emote: Pride}Und das hab ich meinen strammen	Beinmuskeln zu verdanken.{pause 30} {emote: Curious}Darauf	darf man doch stolz sein, {pause 8}oder?{000a-0001-0004-0029-002a}
"011"
"012"	{emote: Worry}Ach, {pause 8}man begann, mich auf der	Straße zu erkennen, und mein	Autogramm war heiß begehrt...	{emote: Aggravation}Schließlich verbrachte ich meine	Zeit nur noch damit, Fotos von	meiner Visage zu signieren.	{emote: Soft Smile}Aber das ist schon lange her.{pause 20}	{emote: Flourish}Inzwischen genieße ich mein	Leben wieder!	Nun singe ich nur noch unter der	Dusche, {emote: Glee}{pause 8}aber ich klinge noch immer	fantastisch!
"013"	{emote: Worry}Ja, {pause 8}es ist eine traurige Geschichte.{pause 30}{emote: Aggravation}	Ich hätte erwartet, dass sie dich	interessiert!
"014"	{emote: Disagreement}Das Flamencotanzen erfordert	eben die entsprechende Musik,{pause 8}	{Player nickname (green)}.	Ich trat generell nur im Trio auf,	mit einem qualifizierten Sänger	und einer begnadeten Gitarristin.	{emote: Flourish}Sonst kommt mein tänzerisches	Talent nicht richtig zur Geltung.{Wait for input}{emote: Disagreement}Aber es ist schwierig geworden,	begnadete Musiker zu finden, die	mir aushelfen wollen.{000a-0000-0006-0f03-1000-cd00}
"015"	{emote: Soft Smile}Vielleicht mache ich für dich eine	Ausnahme und tanze dir auch so	mal einen Flamenco vor.	{emote: Showmanship}Oder wir schwingen zusammen das	Tanzbein und wagen gemeinsam den	{capitalized}{Town name (pink)}-Walzer!{emote: Star Yell}
"016"	{emote: Thought}Vermutlich würde es auch nicht	schaden, wenn ich dir einige meiner	besseren Tanzschritte zeigen würde.	{emote: Showmanship}Olé!{pause 40} Nicht schlecht, {pause 8}oder?{pause 20} Ich bin	sicher die talentierteste Tänzerin	in ganz {Town name (pink)}.
"017"	Ja, {pause 8}enttäuschend.{pause 20}{emote: Anger} {capitalized}{Town name (pink)}	ist eben zu provinziell für meine	Großstadtambitionen, {pause 8}{catchphrase}.
"018"	Nun,{pause 8} es machte mir einst Spaß,	mich zu verkleiden und andere	Personen zu mimen.	{emote: Sunny}Aber eines Tages bemerkte ich	dann, dass ich mich in meiner	eigenen Haut am wohlsten fühle.{000a-0000-0006-1304-1400-cd00}
"019"	{emote: Soft Smile}Vor allem, da ich nun zahlreiche	wahre Freunde in {Town name (pink)} habe.{pause 30}	Freunde wie dich, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}!	{emote: Happiness}Ja, {pause 8}das mag theatralisch klingen,{pause 8}	aber gute Freunde sind zum Glück	eben unabdingbar.
"020"	Deshalb ist {Town name (pink)} äußerst	angenehm als Wohnort, {pause 8}denn hier	wird man so akzeptiert, wie man ist.	{emote: Soft Smile}Und die Nachbarn hier sind alle	äußerst umgänglich{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 20} Du natürlich	eingeschlossen!
"021"	Nun ja.{pause 20} Leider wird die hohe Kunst	durch Trivialitäten wie Ruhm und	Prominenz abgewertet{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.	{emote: Sheepishness}Aber ist man die Autogrammjäger	erst einmal los, lebt es sich plötzlich	viel ungenierter, {pause 8}{catchphrase}!
"022"	Es mag etwas dauern, bis man das	Spiel gut beherrscht.{pause 20}{emote: Sheepishness} Aber es wäre	schön, es mal mit dir zu spielen.
"023"	{emote: Sheepishness}Wenn du meinst, du wirst nie so gut,	dass du mich schlagen könntest,	hast du sicher recht!
"024"	{emote: Sheepishness}Wir sollten es mal spielen, sobald du	die Regeln begriffen hast,{pause 8} {emote: Glare}aber noch	bevor du so gut bist wie ich!
"025"	{emote: Alarmed}Ja?{pause 40} Es kann äußerst einschüchternd	sein, sich an einem neuen Ort allein	zurechtfinden zu müssen.	{emote: Agreement}Andererseits ist es sehr angenehm,	sich umzusehen, ohne sich nach	jemandem richten zu müssen.{000a-0001-0004-001a-001b}
"026"	{emote: Happiness}Ich wusste gar nicht, dass du schon	so viel Abenteuerliches erlebt hast.{Wait for input}Du musst mir unbedingt mal in aller	Ausführlichkeit deine Erlebnisse	schildern!
"027"	{emote: Happiness}Inspirierend, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}!{pause 20} Ich sollte	auch mal meinen Koffer packen	und in die Ferne schweifen.
"028"	{emote: Sheepishness}Das verstehe ich.{pause 20} Es ist einfacher,	mit Familie oder Freunden zu	verreisen.	{emote: Surprise}Allerdings ist es auch sehr erhellend,	in einer neuen Umgebung auf sich	selbst angewiesen zu sein.	{emote: Agreement}Du solltest es auch einmal wagen,{pause 8}	{Player nickname (green)}.{pause 8} Es wird dir bestimmt	die Augen öffnen!
"029"	{emote: Agreement}Das ist nachvollziehbar.{pause 20} Ein neues	Buch, {pause 8}die frischen Seiten, {pause 8}die	Druckerschwärze, {pause 8}der Geruch...	{emote: Love}Das hat doch wirklich einen ganz	besonderen Charme!{pause 30} Aber auch	Altes kann von neuem Wert sein.	Ich empfehle dir, gelegentlich auch	Klassiker einmal mehr zu lesen und	neu für dich zu entdecken.
"030"	{emote: Soft Smile}Dann sind wir einer Meinung!{pause 30} Alte	Bücher sind fast wie alte Freunde,{pause 8}	nicht wahr?	{emote: Agreement}Und hat man etwas eine Zeit lang	nicht mehr gelesen, {pause 8}liest es sich	plötzlich doch ganz anders.	In guten Büchern kann man eben	auch nach Jahren noch Neues	entdecken!
"031"	{emote: Alarmed}Wie bitte? {pause 16}{0007-000a-0000}Du liest überhaupt nicht?{pause 20}	Aber {Player nickname (green)}!{pause 20}{emote: Sadness} Das ist wahrlich	enttäuschend.	{emote: Anger}Bestimmt willst du mich einfach nur	an der Nase herumführen.{Wait for input}Du liest doch heimlich nachts unter	der Bettdecke!{Wait for input}{emote: Happiness}Dabei ist Lesen nichts, für das man	sich schämen muss.
"032"	{emote: Soft Smile}Das ist sehr lobenswert!{pause 20} Am besten	sieht man die Welt, wenn man noch	jung ist.	Im Alter gewöhnt man sich nämlich	an einen gewissen Lebensstandard.{pause 20}	Wer mag schon Herbergen?	{emote: Anger}Besonders, wenn die Mitbewohner	nachts um 2 Uhr die Zimmertür als	Tor zum Fußball spielen nutzen!	{emote: Aggravation}Das ist sooo nervig!{pause 40}{0007-000b-0000} IST ES DENN	SO SCHWER ZU VERSTEHEN,	DASS ICH SCHLAFEN MÖCHTE?!	{emote: Disbelief}Äh{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 20} Entschuldige.{pause 20} Ich habe da wohl	noch ein paar unverarbeitete	Erinnerungen.
"033"	{emote: Soft Smile}Das ist gut.{pause 20} Auch wenn man nicht so	oft und nicht sehr weit in die Ferne	schweift, ist es die Erfahrung wert.	{emote: Agreement}Trotzdem sei erwähnt, dass das	Abenteuer mit der Entfernung zu	{Town name (pink)} zunimmt.	{emote: Soft Smile}Du solltest in jungen Jahren so viel	wie möglich die Welt erkunden, {pause 8}denn	im Alter ändern sich die Prioritäten.	Früher bin ich verreist, habe Berge	erklommen, Museen besucht und die	unsäglichsten Gerichte probiert.	Heutzutage liege ich lieber faul am	Strand und ärgere mich, dass es	{keinen/keine/kein} {0005-0013-0002-0000} gibt...
"034"	{emote: Alarmed}Oh, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}, {pause 8}da entgeht dir aber	etwas!{Wait for input}Es gibt doch so viel zu erleben, {pause 8}so	viele nette Leute kennenzulernen,{pause 8}	so viele Gerichte zu kosten!	{emote: Agreement}Du solltest dich einmal trauen,{pause 8}	{Player nickname (green)}.{pause 20} Auch ein Kurztrip übers	Wochenende wäre schon ein Anfang!
"035"	{emote: Anger}Und Individuen, die ihre Kaugummis	laut schmatzend kauen?{pause 20} Schrecklich!{Wait for input}Ich persönlich sehe da dringenden	Handlungsbedarf vonseiten unserer	Legislative.
"036"	{emote: Alarmed}Oh!{pause 40} Diese Ambivalenz{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 20}{emote: Aggravation} Gehörst du	etwa auch zu diesen unleidlichen	Spaghettischlürfern?{pause 20} Hmmm?!	{emote: Anger}Ich erkläre es dir mal ganz langsam,	zum Mitschreiben.{pause 20} Man wickelt die	Spaghetti vorsichtig um die Gabel.	Nicht zu viele!{pause 20} Nur so viele, wie man	mit einem Bissen verzehren kann.{pause 20}	Und lass sie nicht herunterhängen!	Das war's auch schon.{pause 20} Ist das denn	wirklich so schwer?!
"037"	{emote: Soft Smile}Dann weißt du, wie ich mich fühle.{pause 20}	An Tagen wie diesem würde ich mir	gerne den Kopf rasieren.	{emote: Inspired}Dann könnte ich mich auch meines	Kamms entledigen und die zusätzlich	gewonnene Zeit sinnvoll nutzen.	Andererseits:{pause 40} Wenn mein Haar doch	mal tut, was es soll, ist es all die	Mühen wert,{pause 8} findest du nicht?{000a-0001-0004-0026-0027}
"038"	In {Town name (pink)} ist man zum Glück	tolerant und jeder kann mit seiner	eigenen Frisur glücklich sein.	{emote: Agreement}Daher ist es sicher das Beste, sich	nicht von widerspenstigen Haaren	den Tag trüben zu lassen.
"039"	{emote: Glare}Es ist sicher das Beste, sich nicht	von widerspenstigen Haaren den	Tag trüben zu lassen.	Wie sagt man doch so schön?{Wait for input}„Die Widerspenstigkeit der Haare	steht in direkter Relation zur	Entfernung des Glätteisens.“{pause 20}{emote: Laughter} Haha!
"040"	{emote: Alarmed}Ach ja?{pause 20} Also, an Selbstvertrauen	mangelt es dir offensichtlich nicht.{Wait for input}Allerdings ist das, was sich auf dem	Kopf abspielt, {pause 8}{emote: Agreement}weniger wichtig als	das, was sich darin abspielt.
"041"	{emote: Glare}Ich sollte nicht angeben, {pause 8}aber beim	letzten Marathon in {Town name (pink)}	belegte ich den ersten Platz!
"042"	{emote: Sunny}Falls du Tipps brauchst, um deine	persönliche Marathonzeit zu	verbessern, helfe ich dir gerne!

"045"	{emote: Fearful}Brrr, {pause 8}wie kalt! {pause 40}{emote: Sigh}Aber wenigstens liegt	Schnee, {pause 8}sodass die Kälte zumindest	auch Vorteile hat.	{emote: Inspired}Weißt du, was das Gute an Schnee	ist, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}?{pause 20} Man kann damit	einen Schneemann bauen!	{emote: Disbelief}Du weißt nicht, wie das geht?{pause 40}	Du musst doch nur vorsichtig	Schneekugeln herumrollen.	{emote: Agreement}Rolle sie nicht ins Wasser und rolle	nur eine Schneekugel auf einmal!{pause 20}	Staple sie, wenn sie groß genug sind.	Ich bin schon gespannt, was für	einen Schneemann du bauen wirst,{pause 8}	{Player nickname (green)}!
"046"	Weißt du, was an diesem Wetter so	vorteilhaft ist, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}? {pause 20}{emote: Sunny}Man	kann einen Schneemann bauen.	{emote: Sheepishness}Du weißt ja, dass ein Schneemann	mehr ist als zwei Schneekugeln,	die aufeinandergestapelt sind.	{emote: Soft Smile}Man kann ein kleines Schneebaby	bauen, {pause 8}ein mittelgroßes Schneekind,{pause 8}	oder einen großen Schneepapa.	{emote: Curious}Was wohl geschieht, wenn man	eine ganze Schneefamilie baut?{pause 20}	Man sollte es mal ausprobieren.

"048"	Wann immer ich {0005-0013-0002-0000}	esse, muss ich an meine Kindheit	denken!	{emote: Love}Meine Mutti ist eine ausgezeichnete	Köchin.{pause 40} {emote: Curious}Gibt es ein Gericht, das dich	auch an deine Kindheit erinnert?{Player can respond (0005):0031-0015-0032-0028}	Natürlich!	Nein, eigentlich nicht.
"049"	{emote: Delight}Das freut mich!{pause 20} Ich fürchte, eines	Tages wachsen Kinder nur noch mit	Tiefkühlkost auf.	{emote: Thought}Wirst du bei {0005-0013-0002-0000}	auch ganz nostalgisch?{pause 20} Oder etwa	bei {0005-0013-0002-0001}?	{emote: Glare}So oder so solltest du dir besser	das Rezept aufschreiben und es mal	deinen eigenen Kindern kochen.
"050"	{emote: Worry}Nicht?{pause 40} Dabei sind der Geruchssinn	und der Geschmackssinn sehr eng	mit unserem Gedächtnis verknüpft.	Ich sollte dir gelegentlich ein für	{Town name (pink)} typisches Gericht	zubereiten.	{emote: Anger}Aber es gehört nicht zu meinen	Aufgaben, dich zu bemuttern!
"051"	Was hältst du von {0005-0011-0002-0100},	{pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}?{pause 20} Hast du Talent dazu?{Player can respond (0005):0034-0000-0035-0028}	Woher weißt du das?	Nein, gar kein Talent.
"052"	{emote: Sheepishness}Ich habe ein Gespür für so etwas!	{pause 20}Du siehst eben aus wie jemand, der	sich für {0005-0011-0002-0100} interessiert.	{emote: Glare}Sieh es als Kompliment, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}!{pause 20}	Du machst den Eindruck {eines/einer}	{sportlichen jungen Mannes/sportlichen jungen Dame}!
"053"	{emote: Sheepishness}Vielleicht solltest du es trotz allem	einmal probieren.{pause 20}{emote: Glare} Allein schon für	das hübsche Outfit!
"054"	Sag mal, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)},{pause 8}{emote: Curious} was trägst	du denn zu Hause, wenn du dich	entspannst?{Player can respond (0000):0037-0000-0038-0000}	Etwas Bequemes.	Etwas Trendiges.
"055"	{emote: Agreement}Ich ebenso!{pause 20}{emote: Resigned} Wozu sollte man sich	schick anziehen, wenn man sowieso	nur auf dem Sofa liegt?
"056"	{emote: Shocked}Wirklich?{pause 40} Wen möchtest du denn zu	Hause beeindrucken?{pause 20}{emote: Anger} Das ist doch	verlorene Liebesmüh.
"057"	{000a-0001-0004-003a-003b}
"058"	{emote: Curious}Das mag jetzt eine seltsame Frage	sein, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)},{pause 8} aber verwendest	du gelegentlich Make-up?{Player can respond (0005):003c-0015-003d-0028}	Manchmal.	Wie bitte?! Niemals!
"059"	{emote: Soft Smile}Unter uns gesprochen, {pause 8}{Player nickname (green)}{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 20}	Verwendest du normalerweise	Make-up?{Player can respond (0005):003e-0015-003f-0028}	Ja, das tue ich.	Normalerweise nicht.
"060"	{emote: Disbelief}So was!{pause 20} Die Zeiten ändern sich,	wenn jetzt sogar schon Männer	Make-up tragen{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.	{emote: Pride}Aber ich bin natürlich für den	Fortschritt und applaudiere jedem,	der auf sein Äußeres achtet!
"061"	{emote: Agreement}Nun, {pause 8}du hast schließlich auch gute	Haut und einen schönen Teint.{Wait for input}Aber in letzter Zeit sieht man	immer öfter Männer mit Eyeliner	und dergleichen.	{emote: Happiness}Es ist schließlich keine Schande,	gut aussehen zu wollen.
"062"	{emote: Agreement}Ich ebenso.{pause 20} Es spricht schließlich	nichts dagegen, einen trüben Tag	mit etwas Farbe aufzuwerten.	{emote: Happiness}Andererseits sind ein freundliches	Lächeln und gütige Augen wesentlich	effektiver als jede Schminke.
"063"	{emote: Alarmed}Wirklich?{pause 20} Du siehst toll aus!{pause 20} Ich mag	deinen natürlichen Look und deinen	schönen Teint!	{emote: Mischief}Du musst mir bei Gelegenheit	das Geheimnis deiner Hautpflege	erläutern,{pause 8} {Player nickname (green)}.
