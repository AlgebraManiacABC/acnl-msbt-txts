"185"	Es gibt zwei Möglichkeiten, Spieler	aus einer anderen Stadt einzuladen:{Wait for input}(1) Lokaler Modus	(2) Online-Modus{Wait for input}Der lokale Modus ermöglicht es	dir, andere Spieler in deiner Nähe	in deine Stadt einzuladen.	Diese müssen dazu ebenfalls	{Green}Animal Crossing: New Leaf {Green}-{Green}	Welcome amiibo{Color Reset} spielen.{Wait for input}Findet ein Freund deine Stadt nicht,	spielt er vielleicht eine andere	Version des Spiels.{Wait for input}Im Online-Modus kannst du auf	deinem System registrierte	Freunde in deine Stadt einladen.	Bis zu drei Spieler können deine	Stadt gleichzeitig besuchen.
"186"	Wenn dein Bahnsteig geöffnet ist,	können dich bis zu drei Spieler aus	anderen Städten besuchen.	Im lokalen Modus kann es vor-	kommen, dass du von Spielern	besucht wirst, die du nicht kennst.	Schließe daher am besten den	Bahnsteig, sobald die gewünschten	Besucher eingetroffen sind.	Während eines Besuchs hast du die	Möglichkeit, {Blue}START {Color Reset}zu drücken und	{Blue}Besucher heimschicken{Color Reset} zu wählen.	Wenn du dies tust, verlassen alle	Besucher sofort deine Stadt und	der Bahnsteig wird geschlossen.	Damit endet auch die	Kommunikation mit	deinen Besuchern.

Sie können auch aus jedem anderen	Schließfach oder Schrank wieder	herausgenommen werden.	Das ist sehr praktisch, wenn man	auf Reisen ist, also mach ruhig	fleißig Gebrauch davon!
"188"	Sprich mit dem Bahnhofspersonal,	wenn du in deine eigene Stadt	zurückkehren möchtest.	Der Gastgeber hat jederzeit die	Möglichkeit, dich heimzuschicken.	Sei also gewarnt.	Denke auch immer daran, dass du	nicht speichern kannst, bevor du in	deine eigene Stadt zurückkehrst.

Im Online-Modus hast du außerdem	die Möglichkeit, deinen Bahnsteig	nur für beste Freunde zu öffnen.	Wenn du dies tust, erfahren nur	deine besten Freunde, dass der	Bahnsteig geöffnet ist.	Auch kannst du mit deinen besten	Freunden über die drahtlose Ver-	bindung Nachrichten austauschen.	Das funktioniert sogar dann, wenn	ihr euch nicht in derselben Stadt	befindet.
"190"	So kannst du einen besten Freund	registrieren:{Wait for input}Öffne die Liste der Personen, mit	denen du spielst, auf dem	Touchscreen.	Wähle dann die Person aus, die	du als besten Freund registrieren	möchtest.	Das ist nur mit Spielern möglich, die	auf deinem Nintendo 3DS-System	bereits als Freunde registriert sind.	Wenn du den Spieler noch nicht als	Freund registriert hast, musst du	dies zuerst tun.
