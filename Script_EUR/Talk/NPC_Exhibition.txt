"031"	{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}First of all,{pause 10} thank you for visiting	{emote: Sunny}the {Blue}HH Showcase{Color Reset}!{Wait for input}{emote: Reset}{capitalized}{Player name}, since this is your first	time visiting us,{pause 10} I'd like to briefly	explain about our space here.
"032"	First of all,{pause 10} this is the entrance.{Wait for input}There are three exhibition areas for	you to view—{pause 5}one to the left, one to	the right, and one in the back.	{emote: Happiness}You can reference the {Blue}Touch Screen	{Color Reset}for a detailed map!

We'll deliver it to you later!
"034"	{emote: Thought}Lastly,{pause 10} I've got one more important	thing to tell you{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{Wait for input}{emote: Worry}If you see someone suspicious or	find a model home that's not	appropriate for public display{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.	{emote: Reset}please ask the person to leave, or	go to the model home and request	it be removed from the area.	{emote: Happiness}Once you've done that, we'll take	care of the rest as soon as we can!
"035"	{emote: Reset}Well, I believe that's all from me!{Wait for input}	{emote: Happiness}{pause 5}I hope you enjoy your time in the	HH Showcase!
"036"

"039"	{emote: Happiness}Some home construction has also	recently taken place,{pause 10} so be sure	to go have a look!
"041"	{emote: Happiness}Well, hello there!{pause 15} Can I assist you	with anything at this time?{000f-0007-0008-0000-0000-0000-0028}	I'd like to go home.	Current model home.	I have a question!	Nope, nothing.
"042"	I see.{pause 10} {emote: Happiness}Well, I'll be here if ever you	need me!
"043"	{emote: Happiness}You'd like to know about the data	provided from this town to other	HHA members, is that right?
"044"	Currently,{pause 5} your house is being shown	as the model home representing	{Town name (pink)}. And I thank you for it!
"045"	If you'd like to show the house of	another member from this town...{Wait for input}that member would have to come	here personally so we can go	through the necessary procedures!
"046"	{emote: Thought}Currently,{pause 10} {0011-0000-0002-0000}'s house is	the model being shown to represent	{Town name (pink)}{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.	{emote: Reset}Would you like to change it so your	{emote: Curious}house is shown as the model home?{pause 10}{confirmation-02}{000f-0005-0004-0015-0028}	Yes, please!	No, leave it as is.
"047"	Of course. Understood!{Wait for input}	{emote: Happiness}I'll just leave the status quo.{pause 5}
"048"	Excellent. Understood!{Wait for input}	{emote: Happiness}I'll make the arrangements!{pause 5}
"049"	{emote: Sunny}Thank you for your patience!{Wait for input}	{emote: Reset}From now on, your house will	be shown as the model home!	{emote: Happiness}I hope many members get to see it!
"050"
"051"
"052"
"053"	{emote: Curious}What would you like to hear about?{000f-0008-000a-0000-0000-0000-0000-0028}	This town's model.	Other model homes.	Ordering furniture.	Blocking users.	Never mind.
"054"	{emote: Curious}Would you like to hear about	anything else?{000f-0008-000a-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000}	This town's model.	Other model homes.	Ordering furniture.	Blocking users.	No, thank you.
"055"	From each town,{pause 10} there's one model	home representing the town, and it	gets shown to everyone!	If you'd like to change the house	representing your town, the	process is fairly simple.	Whoever wants to have their home	represent {Town name (pink)} just needs to	come speak to me about it.
"056"	In our showcase, there's enough	space to accommodate up to 48	model homes!	When we run out of open space,{pause 10} the	newer model homes will replace the	old ones in order.	If you'd like to keep displaying a	specific house,{pause 10} be sure to use the	{Blue}Mark as favorite{Color Reset} option!{pause 5}	{emote: Happiness}If you want to move a model home	to or from your favorites, use the	sign in front of it.	{emote: Reset}But{pause 10} keep in mind you can only	mark up to 16 homes as your	favorites.{pause 5} No more than that!
"057"	{emote: Happiness}You're free to look inside the model	homes here all you like.{Wait for input}{emote: Reset}Plus,{pause 5} excluding some exceptions,{pause 5}	you can purchase the furniture in	the homes via mail-order service!	If you'd like to buy an item, simply	order it from the {Blue}Touch Screen{Color Reset}	while you're in the house.
"058"	{emote: Worry}If you find someone suspicious{pause 10}	or a model home that's rather	inappropriate for public display{pause 8}.{pause 8}.{pause 8}.	{emote: Reset}be sure to ask that person to leave.{pause 10}{Wait for input}You can also check the sign next to	the home and request that it no	longer be displayed in our town.	When doing so,{pause 10} you can choose if	the offensive person or home should	be removed temporarily or forever.	If the user is removed temporarily,{pause 10}	he or she can return once you tag	them via StreetPass again.	If you choose to {Blue}block {Color Reset}the user	forever, well, that's quite different.{Wait for input}He or she won't be displayed in the	showcase ever again, even if you	tag them in the future.	Please be aware that it may prevent	you from seeing that same player's	content in other games as well.

Elegir una casa distinta para	representar a este pueblo{pause 10} es	un proceso bien sencillito.

En tal caso,{pause 10} puedes elegir que	esa persona se retire de forma	temporal o permanente.	Si quieres que sea temporalmente,{pause 10}	puede volver si te la encuentras	mediante StreetPass.	Bloquear a alguien de manera	permanente ya es otro cantar.{Wait for input}No podrá volver a la exposición	nunca más por mucho que te la	encuentres.	Ten en cuenta que tal decisión	puede impedir que veas su	contenido en otros juegos.

Diese werden von Doppelgängern	der jeweiligen Mitglieder bevölkert.{pause 10}	{emote: Soft Smile}Ein faszinierendes Konzept, oder?
"014"	Leider hast du bis jetzt noch keine	Daten von anderen Mitgliedern der	AdsH erhalten...	Deshalb sind im Moment noch keine	Häuser ausgestellt. {pause 20}Aber mach dir	keine Sorgen!	Sobald die ersten Häuser im	Musterdorf gebaut sind, wirst	du es sofort erfahren!

Bitte die Person zu gehen oder geh	zum entsprechenden Musterhaus	und beantrage dessen Entfernung.	{emote: Happiness}Wenn du das tust, kümmern wir uns	so schnell wie möglich um den Rest.
"035"	{emote: Reset}Aber ich rede schon viel zu viel!{Wait for input}	{emote: Happiness}Ich hoffe, du genießt deinen	Aufenthalt im AdsH-Musterdorf.

"045"	Auch ein anderes Mitglied aus dieser	Stadt kann an deiner Stelle sein	Haus ausstellen.	Dieses Mitglied müsste allerdings	persönlich hierherkommen, um die	nötigen Schritte einzuleiten.
"046"	{emote: Thought}Im Augenblick wird {Town name (pink)}	durch das Haus von {0011-0000-0002-0000}	repräsentiert.{emote: Reset}	Möchtest du das ändern und {emote: Curious}dein	Domizil als Musterhaus für diese	Stadt präsentieren?{pause 10}{confirmation-02}{000f-0005-0004-0015-0028}	Ja, ganz unbedingt!

Wenn du möchtest, dass ein anderes	Haus deine Stadt repräsentiert, ist	nur eine einfache Änderung nötig.	Bitte den Besitzer des Hauses, sich	hier zu melden, {emote: Happiness}und ich erledige alle	weiteren Formalitäten. {pause 20}Ganz simpel!
"056"	In unserem Musterdorf haben wir	Platz für bis zu 48 Musterhäuser.{Wait for input}Haben wir irgendwann keinen Platz	mehr, ersetzen die neueren Häuser	der Reihe nach die älteren.

Möchtest du ein Item kaufen, bestell	es einfach über den {Blue}Touchscreen{Color Reset},	während du dich im Haus befindest.
"058"	{emote: Worry}Es kann vorkommen, dass dir	verdächtige Personen oder unange-	messene Musterhäuser auffallen.	{emote: Reset}In solchen Fällen solltest du die	betreffende Person darum bitten,	zu gehen.	Am Schild vor dem Musterhaus	kannst du beantragen, dass es	hier nicht mehr ausgestellt wird.	Dabei kannst du wählen, ob die	Person bzw. das Haus zeitweise	oder dauerhaft entfernt werden.	Bei zeitweiser Entfernung kann die	Person bei der nächsten Begegnung	über {Blue}StreetPass {Color Reset}zurückkommen.	Wählst du jedoch die Option	{Blue}Blockieren{Color Reset}, wird diese Person	dauerhaft entfernt.	Diese Person kann das Musterdorf	nie wieder betreten, selbst wenn	ihr euch erneut begegnet.	Eventuell werden Inhalte dieser	Person dadurch auch in anderen	Spieletiteln nicht mehr angezeigt.
